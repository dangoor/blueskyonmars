Way back (in August, I think), when Google was floating potential prices for their stock, they talked about as high as $135 per share. I remember the press thinking this was ludicrous. Google, of course, ended up selling their shares via Dutch Auction at $85. It turns out that they may not have been off in their original pricing&#8230; Google today hit [$135 per share][1]. GOOG is a great company with great market positioning, so they have good reason to be a Wall St. darling.
