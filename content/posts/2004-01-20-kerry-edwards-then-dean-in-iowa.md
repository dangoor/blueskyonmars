In a sure sign that money is not everything, former front runner Howard Dean [came in third][1] in the Iowa caucuses with just 18%. Kerry won Iowa with 38%, followed by Edwards with 32%. Makes it look like a whole different race!

May the best man win, because we need a good candidate come November.
