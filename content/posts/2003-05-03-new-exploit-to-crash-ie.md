Secunia has a description of [a way to crash IE with a trivial bit of HTML.][1] I usually don&#8217;t get into security vulnerability news, but this is funny because of how trivial the exploit is. Create a form with an &#8220;input type crash&#8221; tag and boom, IE crashes. Wonder how long it will be before someone makes an email bot of some kind that sends this in an email message to crash people&#8217;s Outlook and Outlook Expresses. Since I use Moz, this had no effect on me&#8230;
