[Boing Boing: India&#8217;s amazing statement on IP and international development][1] actually sounds a lot like our Constitution:

> The legal monopoly granted to IP owners is an exceptional departure from the general principle of competitive markets as the best guarantee for securing the interest of society. The rationale for the exception is not that extraction of monopoly profits by the innovator is, of and in itself, good for society and so needs to be promoted.

Too many people in Congress are being swayed by lobbying from the RIAA and the MPAA, and too many citizens are allowing it to happen. I think many people are not aware of the fact that the public domain is truly the norm and the copyrights are the exception.
