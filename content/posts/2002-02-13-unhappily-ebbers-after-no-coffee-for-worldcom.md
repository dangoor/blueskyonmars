Having worked at a small company that was acquired by WorldCom, I know a number of people who still work there. I had heard before about WorldCom cutting off the coffee supply to the employees, and I&#8217;m happy to see [that the press has picked up on this, too][1]. WCOM claims they will save $4-6 million a year by not supplying free coffee. How short-sighted are these people? $4M from a $30 BILLION a year company? Sheesh. Sounds like a good time to clean up the resume and find a company that appreciates its employees, rather than viewing them as a liability.
