It sounds like people are getting serious about Linux on the desktop, but [this announcement shows just how big it is starting to get][1]:

> [Sun CEO Scott] McNealy announced today that the Chinese government has pledged to deploy a million computers in the next year using Sun&#8217;s Linux desktop software. The cost: $50 per license for Sun&#8217;s desktop software

The more this kind of thing spreads, the more price pressure that will put on Microsoft. Microsoft has _huge_ margins (I believe last quarter they made $2.2 billion in profit on $2.8 billion in Windows revenue!) and plenty of room to wiggle. The problem is that investors are used to Microsoft&#8217;s 30%+ net profit margin.

This is really just the beginning, though. Things will really heat up in the years leading up to Longhorn&#8217;s release.
