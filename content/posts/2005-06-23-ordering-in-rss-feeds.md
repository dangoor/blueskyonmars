CNET reports that [Microsoft wants to extend RSS to include ordering information][1] for things like best seller lists. The funny thing about this is that XML (and RSS is XML) already has an implied ordering. It&#8217;s then up to a human to decide whether or not they care about that ordering. All you would really need added to RSS is a flag that says &#8220;ordering in this feed is important&#8221;.

Zesty News, which I promise \*will\* be released one of these days, already allows you, the reader of a feed, to decide whether you care about the ordering of items. I use this myself on feeds like the BBC&#8217;s Top Stories and the Blogdex popular entries.

Even if there was a flag in the feed saying &#8220;order is important&#8221;, I think it&#8217;s still nice to give the reader of the feed a choice. That&#8217;s the beauty of RSS (and other XML formats): it&#8217;s machine understandable, so the client software can really do useful stuff with the information that comes in.
