The [Michigan Python Users Group][1] (MichiPUG) December meeting is coming up this Thursday, December 6th at 7PM. We&#8217;ll once again be meeting at the [SRT Solutions][2] office in downtown Ann Arbor.

This month&#8217;s topic is distributed version control systems. I&#8217;ll be talking about/demoing [Mercurial][3], and we&#8217;ll have just general discussion about version control systems and other Python topics.

See you there!
