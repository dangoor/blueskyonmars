For the past couple of years, nearly all of the work I&#8217;ve done has been concerned with what&#8217;s going on on the server. My new group is a small one, so we have to be generalists. This has given me a chance to pick up on what is happening in browser-based user interfaces. Thankfully, things are a lot more pleasant than they were a few years back, particularly if you don&#8217;t care about compatibility with older browsers. At work, my group has an internal customer, so browser compatibility is not an issue there. For my blog, I do this more for myself than for anyone else&#8230; so as long as it&#8217;s compatible with [my browser][1], I&#8217;m happy. Thankfully, creating a nice layout for both Moz and IE using CSS is not very difficult.
