Sal Randolph is [interviewed at the Creative Commons site][1]. She&#8217;s creating a new service called [Opsound][2] that offers CC-licensed music and sounds that other people can use. The article has a lot of discussion about gift economies. Sal concludes with:

> With a large pool of sound files available, many things will be possible. Musicians, sound and video artists will be able to draw on them as elements in new work. For those who aren&#8217;t musicians, there will be the possiblitity of easily creating online microlabels. And of course I&#8217;m hoping for Opsound to be an interesting record label in its own right, producing and selling records and cds, holding events, parties, tours, etc.
