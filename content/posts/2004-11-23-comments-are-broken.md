Thanks to alert reader Andreas, I have discovered that comments on my blog are broken right now. I&#8217;m looking into it.

There appears to be some problem with SCode, the MT plugin that produces captchas for the comments. I&#8217;m not willing to turn off SCode, because I had too much cleanup to do due to comment spam.
