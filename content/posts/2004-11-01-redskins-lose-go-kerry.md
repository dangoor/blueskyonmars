I forgot to pay attention to this yesterday. The Redskins [lost their game to Green Bay][1]. Since 1944, whenever the Redskins have lost their game before the election, the incumbent lost as well. Sure, that&#8217;s a meaningless bit of trivia, but at least the outcome of the game matches up what I&#8217;d like to see.
