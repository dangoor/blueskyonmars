Arts & Farces has a [great article about spam][1] including references to all sorts of anti-spam viewpoints and info. I agree that spam is a huge problem facing the Net and email, and I also agree that the junk fax provision of the law should be extended to junk email. $500 per violation would make spammers think twice. By the way, [SpamAssassin][2] is the best tool I&#8217;ve seen for flagging spam.

Sometimes it flags a real message as spam, but usually it does okay.
