Some sad news this morning: _&#8220;Pakistani police killed three people Friday when they opened fire on pro-Taliban protesters in a nationwide crackdown on a general strike called by Islamic parties against government support for the war on Afghanistan.&#8221;_ I wonder if people in Pakistan are allowed to protest peacefully? Theoretically, that is one thing we are guaranteed in this country.
