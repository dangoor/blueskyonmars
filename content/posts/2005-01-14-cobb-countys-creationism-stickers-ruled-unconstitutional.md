[MSNBC &#8211; Judge nixes evolution textbook stickers][1] talks about Cobb County, GA&#8217;s ridiculous textbook stickers that describe evolution as &#8220;a theory, not a fact&#8221;. It&#8217;s an interesting ruling, and I think it makes sense.

If they want to pursue the whole &#8220;Intelligent Design&#8221; idea, they should look for a textbook that talks about that, rather than slapping bogus stickers on _real_ textbooks.

Either that, or they can try to get President Bush to vie for a constitutional amendment that would &#8220;clarify&#8221; evolution&#8217;s position as a theory ðŸ™‚
