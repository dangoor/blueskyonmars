A DC-area lawyer wrote the amusing [How To Make A Telemarketer Cry (or, Suing Bozos for Fun & Profit)][1], which details his lawsuit against a telemarketer that used a prerecorded message (at 5:45am, no less!) Lots of links to information on tracking down telemarketers and the laws in question. I don&#8217;t think you need to be a lawyer to take advantage of this. Plus, a new option for suing telemarketers is coming later this year with the national &#8220;do not call&#8221; list.
