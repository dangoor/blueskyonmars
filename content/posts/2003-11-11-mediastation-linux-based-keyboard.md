Here&#8217;s an idea that I had a couple of years ago, and I&#8217;m glad to see that someone has brought it into existence: [a Linux-based keyboard][1]. It seemed to me that open source audio software was getting to the point where it could be applied in the pro realm. Beyond that, it seemed to make sense to use commodity parts and software rather than the custom chips and operating systems of years past. Only time will tell if this model wins out and if any of the big names in music gear give it a whirl.
