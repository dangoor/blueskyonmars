Searching for &#8220;old fart&#8221; at Amazon.com today produces [this page][1] with billionaire Jeff Bezos dressed as Austin Powers. The unbelievable irresponsibility of this! The programmers should be _fired_ for pulling a stunt like this! There could be hundreds of people out there, trying to find the thousands of &#8220;Old Fart&#8221; products on Amazon today, only to be turned away by Bezos&#8217; smiling face. Amazon could be losing literally _dollars_ in sales. It could be worse, though. Imagine if Microsoft did a parody of the Matrix starring Ballmer and Gates&#8230;

(Yes, I am kidding. I like Easter Eggs as much as the next guy.)
