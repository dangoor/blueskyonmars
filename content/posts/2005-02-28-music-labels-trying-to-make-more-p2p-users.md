Apparently, the music industry is trying to get more people to start using free peer-to-peer networks for their music. That&#8217;s the only conclusion one can draw from this: [Top music labels try to raise prices for downloads][1]. From a business perspective, trying to figure out what the price sensitivity is makes some amount of sense. However, $0.99 per **DRMed** song is, in my opinion, about as high as one would want to go. Wired&#8217;s frequently cited Long Tail article suggested that even lower prices would be good for a lot of music.

Raising prices on these services will only lead more people to the free networks.
