Neat idea: the [Koders &#8211; Source Code Search Engine][1] lets you search for code with keywords, language and license. Reportedly, they&#8217;ve got 125 million lines of code you can search. Nifty thing about this is that I&#8217;d imagine it&#8217;s all automated. People have written neural net code to automatically identify programming languages, and they can just grab the license off the top of the code. To be sure, Google has worked pretty well for me, but this engine is quite targeted and worth a shot when I&#8217;m looking for something specific.
