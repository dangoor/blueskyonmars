Here is an article [lamenting the loss of the Freedom of Information Act][1]. I agree with what&#8217;s said here. The Constitution is the foundation for a nation that does not trust the government. Our government has purposefully limited powers, and things like the FOIA allow us to ensure that people are not abusing the powers they have been granted.
