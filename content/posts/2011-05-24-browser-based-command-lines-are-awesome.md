Command lines are an amazingly great way to get things done using the keyboard, and using the keyboard is a way to do many things faster than reaching for the mouse. Of course, I&#8217;m a geek and not everyone likes command lines. But, many geeks do&#8230; _and_, I think that what we think of as a command line can move way beyond what a command line was in the &#8217;70s.

[TermKit][2] recently got a good deal of attention, and rightly so. Steven Wittens has created a beautiful command shell that runs in a dedicated browser.

We did a good bit of command line experimentation on the Bespin project, and Joe Walker has continued that experimentation with the [GCLI project][3]. GCLI has been pushing in some directions that Joe has had in mind for a long time (a command line interface that is also mouse-friendly). At work, we&#8217;ve got some big plans for that one. Ajax.org also has a command line (not yet GCLI-based) in their slick [Cloud9 IDE][4].

There&#8217;s also been [Ubiquity][5], which had a &#8220;natural language&#8221; take on the command line. A few months ago, Ian Bicking created his take on a browser-based command shell with [jsshell][6].

All of these are exclusive of the many JavaScript REPLs that exist and have varying and interesting sets of features.

All of these are something that we could loosely call a &#8220;webby CLI&#8221;. So, I&#8217;ve set up a [webby-cli googlegroup][7] for people who want to talk about the concepts, projects and niggling implementation details around bringing a great command line experience into browsery environments. Join us, if you&#8217;re interested in that sort of thing.
