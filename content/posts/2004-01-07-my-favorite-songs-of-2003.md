This is not a top 10 list, because 10 is such an arbitrary number.
  
These are the songs that I really, really liked this year and that I am
  
likely to continue to listen to in the coming years. There are plenty of other songs that I&#8217;ve enjoyed on one level or another, but that just don&#8217;t have that guaranteed replay value for me (&#8220;Hey Ya!&#8221; by OutKast comes to mind as an example of this).

  * &#8220;Bring Me To Life&#8221;, Evanescence
  * &#8220;All The Things She Said&#8221;, TaTu
  * &#8220;Bigger Than My Body&#8221;, John Mayer
  * &#8220;Are You Happy Now&#8221;, Michelle Branch
  * &#8220;Heaven&#8221;, Live
  * &#8220;Numb&#8221;, Linkin Park
  * &#8220;Sonambulist (Simply Being Loved)&#8221;, BT
  * &#8220;Clocks&#8221;, Coldplay
  * &#8220;Disease&#8221;, Matchbox 20
