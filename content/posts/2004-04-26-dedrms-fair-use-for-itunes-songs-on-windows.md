DVD Jon has created a tool [that provides fair use capabilities][1] for owners of iTunes songs under Windows. As long as you have a legitimate key to play the song file, this tool will strip out the DRM. It leaves your username and email address in the file, which is not a problem for you as long as you&#8217;re trying to play fair.
