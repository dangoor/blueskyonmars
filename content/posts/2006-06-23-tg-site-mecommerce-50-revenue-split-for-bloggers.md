TechCrunch has the story today: [GoodStorm to offer e-commerce widget with 50% revenue split for bloggers][1], talking about a new service called MeCommerce. There&#8217;s a whole bunch going on in this one that makes me take notice. 1) MeCommerce was put together by FrozenBear and runs TurboGears under the hood. 2) 50% of retail markup (not revenue, as TechCrunch states) is a sweet deal. 3) People can buy things without leaving your site&#8230; not necessary, but cool. 4) GoodStorm looks like a better deal than CafePress when it comes to shirts.
