Though my iPod is still new enough that its battery is fine, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll run into the reported battery problems down the line. According to MacNN, [Small Dog offers iPod battery replacements][1] in a do-it-yourself kit for $48. They&#8217;ll do the installation for you for an extra $20. These both represent a pretty good discount on Apple&#8217;s $99 price.
