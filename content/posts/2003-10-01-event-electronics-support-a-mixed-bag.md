About 7 weeks ago, I shipped my [EZ8 sound card][1] back to Event Electronics because it was locking my computer up. Within 20 minutes of playing audio, my machine (running Windows XP) would consistently freeze up. Event&#8217;s phone support has been helpful and made a number of suggestions, but I ran through a lot of experimentation before finally sending the card back to them.

They&#8217;ve had the card in their possession for 6 weeks. I&#8217;ve called them up three times. I probably would&#8217;ve called them more if I wasn&#8217;t busy dealing with a hard drive crash. My last call to them (last week), they were actually testing it, but hadn&#8217;t come up with anything yet.

As a computer guy, I can sympathize with the difficulty in reproducing some problems. However, it&#8217;s _their job_ to get this working for me, and preferrably in a more timely manner than this. I had a Frontier Design Wavecenter ISA card for a few years and had no problems whatsoever with it. I wouldn&#8217;t have even needed the EZ8 if it weren&#8217;t for the fact that my new machine doesn&#8217;t have an ISA slot. Ugh.
