On a whim, I decided to see if there was new news of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Indeed [there is][1]. The &#8220;eating and working out&#8221; part of the game mentioned sounds like the kind of thing that could make the game a drag if it&#8217;s done poorly. The GTA series has had great gameplay, though, so I have faith that Rockstar North will get it right.
