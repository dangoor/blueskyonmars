This is the kind of morning I like to wake up to. A very interesting one. The first thing I noticed was email saying my blog was down. (That&#8217;s due to a problem with my MySQL start up script&#8230; I guess the server rebooted but MySQL didn&#8217;t come back.)

Then I saw the mention that [TurboGears has been slashdottted!][1] Thanks to [Guillem Cantallops Ramis][2] for getting us on the front page!

And, I was really excited to see a message from Ned Batchelder letting me know that [the first TurboGears job posting][3] is now up at Python.org.

Wow. All of this on what is a weekend day for me.
