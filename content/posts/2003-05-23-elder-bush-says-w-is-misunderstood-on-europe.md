The article basically states that former President Bush was defending [George W.&#8217;s attitude toward Europe.][1] He cited W.&#8217;s work with the Spanish Prime Minister on the Iraq issue as an example. Of course, the Spanish agreed with Bush, so that&#8217;s not saying much. The article then talks about the reason why the elder Bush was saying anything at all:

> President Bush rankled many in Europe by refusing to join the Kyoto accord on global warming (news &#8211; web sites) and the International Criminal Court. Then his defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, famously wrote off Germany and France as &#8220;old Europe.&#8221; 

Couple that with the fact that most of Europe was against the war in Iraq, and you can see why Europeans are not really bullish on W. In fact, it&#8217;s hard to say how W. is &#8220;misunderstood&#8221; here, when his decisions have been counter to most of Europe&#8217;s.
