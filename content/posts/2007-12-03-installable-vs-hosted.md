37signals doesn&#8217;t want to do installable software, [Ask 37signals: Installable software?][1]:

> If we built installable software weâ€™d have to spend a lot more of our time on technical support, write a lot more documentation, slow down our development process, and lose a fair bit of control over our customer experience. For some companies this wouldnâ€™t be a big deal, but for us it would be a real drag. 

Of course, I recommend you read all of Jason&#8217;s commentary before continuing. Done? Okay&#8230;

I think that Jason is overestimating how hard it can be to produce an installable version of a hosted product. I say &#8220;can be&#8221;, because how an application is built can certainly make it harder. Many small companies (too many to name!) are building nice, installable web-based apps.

Offering a hosted webapp is a great business model for the reasons Jason cites. It&#8217;s also good for customers, because they can be up and running in an instant. I wanted to try out [FogBugz][2] and had my own instance within minutes. And, of course, 37signals doesn&#8217;t have to worry about Basecamp showing up on warez sites. Or the fact that everyone can read their uncompiled Ruby code.

However, I think for a many apps, quite a few potential customers will be left behind by only offering a hosted version. One criticism of Google Apps that I&#8217;ve seen mentioned is that not everyone wants to entrust all of their private documents to Google. I think Campfire looks like an interesting product, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to store company confidential exchanges in there.

I&#8217;ve seen a number of products start off with one approach and then add the other. I can name two off the top of my head that started off installable and added a hosted option. In some ways, _that&#8217;s_ easier because you don&#8217;t have to worry about supporting the service 24&#215;7. There are always tradeoffs in product management, aren&#8217;t there?

I should also mention the middle ground: selling an appliance. This is what [Arbor Networks][3] does. Ship a computer, preconfigured and ready to run, to the customer. They plug that in, do a small bit of configuration (IP address setting, for example) and they&#8217;re up and running! I&#8217;ve predicted before that Google Apps will eventually be offered this way. We&#8217;ll see&#8230;

Also, you can be just as agile with an installable app if you wish to be&#8230; There has been an update to OmniFocus just about every day (including weekends!) since I installed it. If you make it easy for people to install and upgrade, there&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t ship minor updates as frequently as you wish.
