There&#8217;s now a multi-author [Scala Blog][1] that provides info about this very cool language. It sounds like there is a draft of a Scala book about ready, and the [_lift_][2] web framework hits 0.3. Scala and _lift_ are tools to watch, because there is a lot of interesting background going into them. Anyone who has been eyeing Erlang&#8217;s concurrency features should check out Scala, because it gives you the same concurrency features but on top of the JVM with access to Java libraries when you need them.
