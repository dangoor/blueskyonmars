Over the past few months, I&#8217;ve been buying all of my music from the iTunes Music Service. The reason I finally gave in and started buying digital tracks is that Apple was offering a convenient, &#8220;real download&#8221; (as opposed to subscription) service that would let me keep my tracks forever. The DRM used by iTMS also wasn&#8217;t overly heinous. Despite that, I&#8217;m not comfortable with having my songs tied to specific machines and software packages. In fact, just recently I read about someone who, due to repairs and machine replacements and such, was having trouble listening to his iTunes songs.

Despite that, I went ahead and started buying, knowing that something like [playfair][1] was right around the corner. It was only a matter of time. Steve Jobs even told the music execs that very thing. People in favor of DRM say it keeps the honest people honest. BS. I&#8217;m an honest person, and I want to get rid of the DRM to ensure the longevity of my purchase. I have no intention of sharing my tunes. My reason for wanting to get rid of the DRM is exactly why the Audio Home Recording Act was enacted.

From what I&#8217;ve read, it looks like PlayFair is not completely convenient to use (I haven&#8217;t tried it yet). Now that the tool exists, though, it&#8217;s just a matter of time before someone provides a script integrated right within iTunes that says &#8220;Remove DRM&#8221;.
