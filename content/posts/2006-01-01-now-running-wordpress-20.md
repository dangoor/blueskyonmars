There&#8217;s nothing quite like an upgrade which is easy, seamless and gives a whole bunch of new features. The [WordPress 2.0][1] upgrade was like that. Nice. I&#8217;ve also switched from the WordPress default theme (which I used for an embarrassingly long time), to the nice and modern [K2][2].

I would certainly like to use a [TurboGears][3]-based blog, but I tend to be more practical than that. WordPress gives me a lot of great blogging features with a giant community supporting it.
