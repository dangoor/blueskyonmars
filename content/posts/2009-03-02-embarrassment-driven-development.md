Googling &#8220;embarrassment driven development&#8221; (EDD) does not return as many hits as it should. I think it&#8217;s a very powerful development technique. I first heard the expression from the Plone guys at PyCon 2006, and Google did turn up this match:

[[ArchipelagoSprint] Time to get cracking on Plone 3.0!][1]

> Wrt. timelines, I was hoping that we could try to have a &#8220;Tech preview&#8221; release before the Plone Conference 2006 in Seattle (October 25-27) &#8211; I&#8217;m going to be on-stage there talking about the exciting new features of Plone 3.0 &#8211; and I&#8217;d like to not be booed off stage. Yes, this is embarrassment-driven development &#8211; as usual. ðŸ˜‰ 

That&#8217;s Alexander Limi illustrating the prime motivator for EDD.

The idea behind EDD is simple: **if you have to demo something in front of an audience, and that something sucks, you will move hell or high water to make sure you don&#8217;t look like an idiot**.

Every product has rough edges and warts, but no one wants a demo to be all warty and to have to say &#8220;yeah, I know you shouldn&#8217;t have to click to the left of the button, but we just haven&#8217;t gotten to that yet&#8221;. EDD ensures that, at least for the parts you have to get up and show, the rough edges will be smoothed _in time for the show_.

I&#8217;m going to be practicing EDD leading up to [JSConf][2]. I want to be able to show some useful, non-trivial bits of [ServerJS][3] work by then.
