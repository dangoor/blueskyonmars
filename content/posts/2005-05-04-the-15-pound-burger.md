After the [defeat of the 6 pound burger][1] in January, a Pennsylvania bar has introduced [the 15 pound burger][2]. The current challenge is for two people to eat that burger in 3 hours. That still makes it 7.5 pounds per person, a 25% elevation over the old burger. At $30, it&#8217;s not such a bad deal if you go in on it with 10 of your closest friends.
