Normally, companies announce _events_, as in something actually happening. In today&#8217;s age of blogging, I decided that I&#8217;ll go ahead and announce that the name of my new company _will not_ be Zesty Software. This is literally a non-event.

For a while now, I had been thinking of using the Zesty name. I&#8217;ve been pretty sure all along that zesty.com would be taken. That&#8217;s a strike against, for sure, but not a deal-breaker. Sure enough, zesty.com is owned by a &#8220;Zesty International&#8221;. Who knows what they do, though, because they haven&#8217;t actually put anything at zesty.com.

The deal-breaker came when I did a Google search for &#8220;zesty software&#8221;. There were no matches, so it looks like the name was not in use. But, a few matches down I saw a reference to spyware that apparently opens up people&#8217;s browsers to a site called ZestyFind (no link provided, because I don&#8217;t want to support those who support spyware). I don&#8217;t know how common the ZestyFind spyware is, but I don&#8217;t want to be associated with that.

Back to the naming drawing board, I guess.
