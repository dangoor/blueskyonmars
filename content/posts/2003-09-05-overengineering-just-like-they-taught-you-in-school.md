Things may have changed a bit in the past 10 years, but back when I was in school it was assumed that change to software was expensive. Working with that assumption, it makes sense to try and design everything to handle any eventuality. As [Luke Hutteman, Rod Johnson and others point out][1], over-engineering really causes more problems than it solves. The notion of [refactoring to patterns][2] appeals far more to me than trying to impose patterns prematurely.
