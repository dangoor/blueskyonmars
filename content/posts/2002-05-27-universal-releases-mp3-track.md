I consider this to be a big deal: Vivendi Universal and Maverick Records have released a new [Meshell Ndegeocello remix][1] for sale online. What&#8217;s unique about this is that the new song is $0.99 and in MP3 format. The price is probably slightly higher than where it should be, but the fact that they released it in MP3 shows that they&#8217;re paying a little bit of attention to what people want.
