Dave Winer, Jeremie and others at Jabbercon worked out [Jabber-RPC][1], which is basically XML-RPC over Jabber. This is useful, because XML-RPC previously didn&#8217;t have a way to get around NAT, and Jabber didn&#8217;t previously have a way to contact services via XML-RPC. Interoperability rules!
