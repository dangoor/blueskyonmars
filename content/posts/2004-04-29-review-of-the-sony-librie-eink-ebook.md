After reading the press releases and initial press coverage of the Sony Librie ebook, along comes [dottocomu: First look at the Sony EBR-1000 Librie eBook reader][1], Kakyou&#8217;s review of the unit. The short of it: great screen, crappy usability, even crappier DRM. Looks like a &#8220;wait for second generation, and its associated software hacks&#8221; sort of product.
