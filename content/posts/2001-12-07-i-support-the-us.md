[Dave Winer][1] linked to an [article about the Reichstag][2] and how Hitler had said that the suspension of rights was not permanent. We know how things went after that.

I support the U.S. and the ideals of America, but that is a much bigger thing than Bush or Ashcroft. The Constitution and Bill of Rights are designed to provide freedom to American individuals and explicitly restrict the capabilities of the government.

The framers of the Constitution had lived through enough despotism. I also believe that people that have been legally granted permanent U.S. residency should be afforded the basic protections that citizens have. They chose to live here because of what the U.S. offers. They pay taxes. I sincerely hope that the courts do not get caught up in the frenzy and do what is truly good for America: protect the rights of the citizens.
