  * _06:54_ interesting. LoudTwitter has magically started working again. [#][1]
  * _06:54_ actually, it&#8217;s not magic&#8230; i logged in a couple days ago and fixed the URL which was somehow missing. [#][2]
  * _08:36_ just took a quick look at Circus Ponies NoteBook. Nice looking app, but I&#8217;ll stick with DEVONThink [#][3]
  * _15:26_ My "Presentation Zen" just arrived. Likely the only presentation book you&#8217;d need. [#][4]
