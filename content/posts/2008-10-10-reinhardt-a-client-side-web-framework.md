At PyCon in March, I spoke about how applications can be browser-driven. For the past few months, I&#8217;ve been involved with a browser-driven app. Remarkably, some of the same kinds of problems crop up when making a browser-driven app as when you&#8217;re making a traditional server-driven webapp. So, today I introduced something called [Reinhardt][1], a client-side web framework. Using Dojo&#8217;s Django Template Engine implementation (dojox.dtl), Dojo&#8217;s data model (dojo.data) and Reinhardt&#8217;s new Django-inspired URL dispatcher you get something that approximates a server-side web framework all on the client side.
