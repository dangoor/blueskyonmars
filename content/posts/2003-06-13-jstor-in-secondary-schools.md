JSTOR has been [expanding into high schools.][1]

> The Porter-Gaud School in Charleston has become one of the first secondary schools in the country to give students online access to more than 300 years of academic journals through JSTOR, an electronic archive mostly found at colleges, universities and major research institutions.

This is cool, because we have a lot of very deep information that high school students can benefit from if they&#8217;re really interested in a subject.
