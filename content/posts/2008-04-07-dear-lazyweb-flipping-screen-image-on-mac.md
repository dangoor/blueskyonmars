It&#8217;s kind of a weird thing to want to do, but I&#8217;d like to be able to &#8220;flip&#8221; the screen image on one of my displays on my Mac, in real time. The Mac lets you rotate the image (in 90 degree increments), but there is no way to make it like an image seen in a mirror. Does anyone know of software that lets you do that?
