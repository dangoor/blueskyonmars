MacOSXHints points out that you can [use iPhoto Buddy to mount network-attached iPhoto libraries][1]. That&#8217;s a very handy tip, given that we have a couple of Macs and a Linux-based fileserver that currently does backup duty. It would be nice if our fileserver would serve up the library live, rather than just on a backup basis. [iPhoto Buddy][2] is free
