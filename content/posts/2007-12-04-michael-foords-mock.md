I&#8217;ve started using [Mock &#8211; Mocking and Test Utilities][1] by Michael Foord (that&#8217;s fuzzyman to you :). Python&#8217;s dynamic nature (monkeypatching and whatnot) means that you don&#8217;t need to come up with some of the elaborate constructs for testing that Javafolk have had to. Mock gives you a few handy features to make stubbing out and verifying behavior easy and natural.

Fuzzyman&#8217;s new release of Mock (0.3.1) includes a couple of features that I suggested to make it more nose-friendly and to eliminate the need for global variables when using the &#8220;patch&#8221; decorator.

Thanks for the groovy module, Michael!
