Part 3 of Bill Venners interview with Ward Cunningham: [To Plan or Not To Plan][1]

> What you end up doing is this: in your head you think, &#8220;Oh! Oh! I know how this is going to come out!&#8221; But then you think, &#8220;Well, it will come out soon enough.&#8221; You could discuss it, but it will come out soon enough. You see stuff coming, but you ask yourself, &#8220;How would I make things better by discussing it?&#8221; We&#8217;re working together and you&#8217;re programming away. I could say, &#8220;Wait! Wait! I know what&#8217;s going to happen down here!&#8221; Well you knew what was going to happen down here. How does it help us get our job done for me to tell you what&#8217;s going to happen down here? You could say, &#8220;Stop! I want to draw on the white board what we&#8217;re going to do tomorrow, because I can see it coming.&#8221; Well maybe I can see it coming too, but why make a commitment? It will come soon enough.

This is very interesting, because I had generally thought that most XP people do _some_ design, rather than rely completely on emergent design. I&#8217;ve generally put a little thought and whiteboarding into a feature before I sit down and start test-driving it. In this interview, Ward talks about using the programming language to communicate directly the idea for how to approach something. Very interesting.
