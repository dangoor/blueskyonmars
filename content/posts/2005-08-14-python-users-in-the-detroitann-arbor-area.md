Since Google searches don&#8217;t turn up much of value here, I&#8217;m curious if there are any folks out there reading this that work with Python and are in the Ann Arbor or Detroit area. I don&#8217;t see signs of an established PUG around here.

**Update**: There are Pythonistas in this area. Rather than replying to this posting, you can now sign up [for michipug][1].
