John Jantsch has a great tip for [getting quality testimonials for your product][1]. The key is rather than asking for a testimonial directly, have a prospective customer ask a current customer for an opinion. You&#8217;ll end up with a better-written testimonial than if you had asked for one directly. I&#8217;ve never tried this myself, but I do believe this would work wonders.
