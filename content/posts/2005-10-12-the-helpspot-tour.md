Ian Landsman has posted a new [tour of HelpSpot][1], and I&#8217;ve got to say that Ian has produced a beautiful looking product. I&#8217;m going to fire it up to get a first hand look after I move everything over to my new server at GoDaddy, but from the tour this is a great looking product for help desks of all sizes (including 1, as Ian has mentioned).
