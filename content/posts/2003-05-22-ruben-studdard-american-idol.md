Despite [landing in the Bottom 2][1] a few weeks ago, [Ruben Studdard][2] was named the second American Idol last night. I&#8217;ve seen 130,000, 13,000 and 1,300 all listed as the difference in votes between Ruben and Clay (with Ryan Seacrest using the 1,300 figure at the end of the show). [E! claims it&#8217;s 130,000][3], which is still a pretty narrow gap out of 24 million votes. It&#8217;s hard to say how accurate the vote was, given that I had tried calling in Tuesday evening and kept getting a busy signal (I finally just sent a text message).

Ruben and Clay are both excellent singers, so the winner of the competition is slightly symbolic: they&#8217;ve both got record deals. And, if they do half as well as Kelly Clarkson, who was awarded a platinum album certification last night, that&#8217;s not too shabby.

Personally, I think [American Juniors][4] is a bad idea. Fox will squeeze all of the life out of American Idol before its time. There&#8217;s plenty to keep AI on people&#8217;s minds: Kelly&#8217;s second single, Justin&#8217;s single and album, the Kelly/Justin movie, Ruben&#8217;s single and possibly Clay&#8217;s, if they decide to release one. That seems like plenty of exposure, and Juniors seems like Fox is just trying to bridge their revenue between seasons of AI.

One final note: Simon Cowell [reportedly][5] wants to return to England to produce. That&#8217;s a shame, because he&#8217;s the judge that everyone heard the most. You always had to wonder what he would say. His comment to Carmen Rasmussen was the most over the top: &#8220;you&#8217;re like that little girl who gets up at the end of the party to sing a song, and the parents are telling her to shut up!&#8221;. Comments extreme as that one aside, Simon really did push people to excel and he said his bit to ensure that talent won over image.
