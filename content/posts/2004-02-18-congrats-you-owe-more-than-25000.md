Regardless of whatever debts you may personally have, the US [national debt now tops $7 trillion][1]:

> In its daily financial statement released on Wednesday, the Treasury said the U.S. debt subject to a congressionally set limit totaled $7.015 trillion, up from $6.983 trillion on Friday. The government was closed on Monday for the Presidents Day holiday.

Assuming 275 million Americans, that means that every American owes more than $25,000. Your standard two adults, two children family owes $100,000. This is why the deficit matters.
