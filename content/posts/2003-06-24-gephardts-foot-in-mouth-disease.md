To the Democratic Party: Please, please, please put forth someone we can vote for. With all of the scary warmongering, privacy invasions, bad treatment of the environment, poor fiscal management, and the appearance of backroom deals with big business that we&#8217;ve seen these past 2.5 years, you&#8217;d think the Democrats could find someone to counter Bush. [This is not the way to win the election][1]:

> &#8220;When I&#8217;m president, we&#8217;ll do executive orders to overcome any wrong thing the Supreme Court does tomorrow or any other day,&#8221; [Rep. Dick] Gephardt said.

That statement is so fundamentally wrong (as numerous other bloggers have pointed out) that I can only assume that Gephardt didn&#8217;t mean it the way it came out. Unfortunately, the only way I can interpret it is that he wants to personally, single-handedly overturn Supreme Court rulings that he disagrees with. If that&#8217;s what he meant, he should probably take another look [at this][2].

I think it&#8217;s time for me to start reading about the candidates the Democrats have lined up and see if there&#8217;s anyone there I can support.
