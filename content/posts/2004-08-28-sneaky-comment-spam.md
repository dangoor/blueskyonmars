Since installing SCode (an MT plugin that adds a captcha for submitting comments), I had not received a single comment spam. This was an improvement, because I think I had comment spam to eliminate every day last week. Somehow, a comment spam made it through last night.

Sure, I&#8217;m only using a 3 digit captcha, but I figured any captcha would be enough to keep the spammers at bay. If I had time, I&#8217;d take a look at the logs and see if I could figure out how they made it through. But, that&#8217;s only one spam, and I really don&#8217;t have the time.
