I wrote about [my Blazing Things VOIP experiment][1]. I&#8217;m going to declare the first round a failure. The softphone X-Lite worked okay, though the sound quality wasn&#8217;t great. The sound quality of the SIPPhone Call-In-One adapter was better. However, there were some problems with the setup:

  * Most importantly, the Call-In-One would freeze up when a call would come in via my LibreTel phone number. Had I gotten my number from SIPPhone.com, this may not have happened. I&#8217;m not willing to expend the effort to find out.
  * SIPPhone.com&#8217;s voice mail system doesn&#8217;t have configurable enough outgoing messages, so I didn&#8217;t want to use their system.
  * When the Call-In-One was up and running, the phone would ring endlessly and never go to voice mail.

My next step is to return the Call-In-One and be done with the &#8220;dirt cheap&#8221; phase of my experiment. My inclination is to use [Packet8][2], because they provide a complete service and seem, on the whole, more committed to a good user experience. SIPPhone and FWD may attract hobbyists, but Packet8 and Vonage are going after everyone with broadband.
