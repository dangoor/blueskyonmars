Alex Russell picked out a few great highlights from the new Dojo 1.1 release and has a nice little essay on open source to boot:

    <br /> I could go on for a long, long time about whatâ€™s great in Dojo 1.1â€¦but Iâ€™ll spare you most of that. James, Pete, Dylan, and the release notes can give you a strong sense of why Dojo 1.1 is the most polished, fastest, and easiest-to-use release of Dojo weâ€™ve ever done. For the impatient, you can already start using it from the CDN without downloading anything.<br /> [From <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=663"><cite>Continuing Intermittent Incoherency Â» Dojo 1.1: Some Awesome For You App</cite></a>]

Dojo is reaping the rewards of having spent <span style="font-style: italic;">a lot</span> of time getting their infrastructure together. 1.1 really improves so many parts of the package.

(ObDisclaimer: I&#8217;m not directly involved in the Dojo project myself, but I work directly with core Dojo folks at [SitePen][1].)
