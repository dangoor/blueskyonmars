Is it just me, or is Firefox a bit of a hog compared to Safari on Mac OS X? I&#8217;ve got a G4 PowerBook, and it runs just fine with Firefox or Safari. But my &#8220;hog-o-meter&#8221; goes off whenever Firefox is running. What is my &#8220;hog-o-meter&#8221;? The fan&#8230; When I&#8217;m using Safari, the PowerBook is entirely silent. When I&#8217;m doing my browsing in Firefox, the fan is almost always running and making some noise.

Safari also feels snappier, which is most likely the difference between a XUL-based application and an entirely native one.

As of today, Firefox with the right plugins is an unbeatable browser for web development. It also continues to have the best &#8220;type ahead find&#8221; implementation I&#8217;ve seen. And, I do come across sites every now and then that just don&#8217;t work in Safari (but that&#8217;s rare enough as to not be a bother).

Browsing is a such a key activity that I don&#8217;t mind slowing down my computer a little bit to use the best browser out there. Safari has made some great strides with each new version&#8230; perhaps what it really needs is an open plugin architecture. There are a bunch of add-ons available, if you take a look at [Pimp My Safari][1], but from what I&#8217;ve read these folks didn&#8217;t have an open front door for extending Safari. They had to take advantage of the fact that Mac OS X Cocoa apps have an exceedingly cool architecture that let&#8217;s you hook into and manipulate objects in the system. (If you&#8217;re a geek and you&#8217;ve got a Mac, you should really check out the [F-Script Anywhere][2] object browser to see just how much you can do without having &#8220;open&#8221; APIs.)
