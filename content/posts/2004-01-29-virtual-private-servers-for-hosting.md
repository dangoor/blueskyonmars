Joe Cheng writes about [using virtual private servers][1] for your hosting. For only $20/month you get root access to a virtual server, giving you full access to run whatever code you need to run. That&#8217;s really, really cool. I&#8217;m quite happy with my $8.45/month service that I have now through [Sitelutions][2], but there are times when being able to run any arbitrary software seems nice.
