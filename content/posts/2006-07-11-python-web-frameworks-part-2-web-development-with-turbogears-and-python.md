Ian Maurer&#8217;s [Python Web frameworks, Part 2: Web development with TurboGears and Python][1] is up on IBM DeveloperWorks now. I haven&#8217;t read his final copy yet, but I did get a chance to read a draft. With today&#8217;s featureful frameworks, there&#8217;s a lot more to write about than can fit into a single introductory article. I&#8217;ve been trying to see slightly different things covered in different places to give people a variety of views into TurboGears. (The 20 Minute Wiki I presented at EuroPython, for example, used widgets, SQLAlchemy and offered tagging, making it quite different from the &#8220;standard&#8221; 20 Minute Wiki.)

Thanks for getting this great article out there, Ian!
