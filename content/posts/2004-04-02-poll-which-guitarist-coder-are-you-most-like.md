Actually, I&#8217;m not taking one of those silly polls ðŸ™‚ I am, however, linking to [Rory Blyth&#8217;s article about wanting U2&#8217;s The Edge to write code][1]. Read the bit about The Edge calling every note &#8220;expensive&#8221;, and you&#8217;ll see that The Edge is a YAGNI sort, applied to music. Cool.
