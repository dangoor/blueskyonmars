Adobe Flex, for folks not aware of it, is a toolkit for creating attractive, functional GUIs easily. It deploys via Flash, so it works just about everywhere (and looks the same in every browser!). Oh yeah, and Flex is free (though Adobe sells an IDE and additional server side tools that do some extra cool things).

Bruce Eckel, host of this weekend&#8217;s TurboGears Jam, and James Ward from Adobe (who will also be at the Jam) did a joint screencast where they show off [how to create a Flex application with TurboGears][1].
