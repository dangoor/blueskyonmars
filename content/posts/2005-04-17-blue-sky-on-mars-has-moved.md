BSOM is now running on its new server at [Hostik][1]. A big thanks to [Sitelutions][2] for two years of great, low-priced service! The reason for the move to Hostik is that I am uncomfortable with a shared server for Blazing Things. So, I&#8217;m moving everything over to a new dedicated server at Hostik.

So far, the Hostik folks have been great and responsive. I&#8217;m running Fedora Core 3 and find myself needing to get up to speed with SELinux quickly.

As of this writing, posting of comments is broken. I hope to fix that soon. Posting of trackbacks is also broken, but I&#8217;m not going to fix that immediately (more on that in another post this evening).
