Earlier this week, Bush declare that he was in charge in his government after media outlets continued to talk about the infighting between Bush&#8217;s cabinet members. Now we get a story of [Bush&#8217;s latest secret order to his staff][1]:

> President Bush &#8211; living up to his recent declaration that he is in charge &#8211; told his top officials to &#8220;stop the leaks&#8221; to the media, or else.
> 
> News of Bush&#8217;s order leaked almost immediately.

A little over a year until the election!
