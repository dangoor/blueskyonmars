[redemption in a blog: Sending to yourname label@gmail.com labels your email][1] talks about using different gmail addresses to automatically sort your mail into labeled groups. gmail apparently allows you to use yourusername+ANYTHING as an address. This is also a good anti-spam technique. Use a different address for every site that you register at. If someone sells your address, you&#8217;ll know who it was and you&#8217;ll be able to just shut down mail that originated there. Very nice!

It&#8217;s a tough call as to whether I&#8217;d want to shift from a desktop (or laptop, in my case) email client to gmail. gmail is very nice. The integrated search of Mac OS 10.4 makes me think that Mail.app will be even spiffier to use.
