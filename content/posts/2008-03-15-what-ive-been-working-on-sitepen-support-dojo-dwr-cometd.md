I&#8217;m at PyCon right now and don&#8217;t have much time to blog (I really try to maximize my limited conference time). But, I can&#8217;t go without bringing attention to: [SitePen Blog Â» Commercial Support Now Available from the Co-Creators and Contributors of the Dojo Toolkit, DWR, and Cometd][1], because this is what I&#8217;ve been working on lately.

SitePen Support is the first &#8220;product&#8221; that I&#8217;ve worked on at SitePen (services can be products, too). We&#8217;ve got a great service to offer to people using the Dojo, DWR and Cometd open source projects and I&#8217;ll have more to talk about soon. We&#8217;ve been doing some really cool stuff with the UI for our support service, and this tied in directly with the talk that I gave at PyCon yesterday. That talk will be online sometime soon.
