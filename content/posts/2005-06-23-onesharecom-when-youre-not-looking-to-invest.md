Right now, Apple (AAPL) is trading for about $39 per share. If you want to get a gift for someone, you can get them [one framed share of Apple][1] for just $122. Or you could get them three shares of stock instead.

Which one would you choose? That says something about you&#8230; a practical person would buy three shares of stock: that&#8217;s three times the dividends (if Apple pays dividends), three times the appreciation and three times the value when sold. A more sentimental person would get the spiffy framed version to put on the wall.

Maybe if I were a true Apple geek, I&#8217;d want one of these. But, I just don&#8217;t see it.
