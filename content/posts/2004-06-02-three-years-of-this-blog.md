I noticed on my &#8220;Looking Back&#8230;&#8221; sidebar that it has now been three years since I started this blog! For those keeping score, this is the second incarnation of my second blog. This was originally called &#8220;We Write Online&#8221;. The Blue Sky On Mars incarnation has been more popular and is now somewhere around a year old.

My first blog came before they were called blogs and was humor based: [Byproducts.com][1] started off as News Byproducts but expanded to more general Byproducts.
