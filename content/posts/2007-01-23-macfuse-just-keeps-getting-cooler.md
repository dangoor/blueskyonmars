[macfuse][1] brings the goodness of the FUSE project to the Mac, and the project just keeps getting better. I&#8217;m just about to install the newest version, which apparently features a small GUI to help you mount volumes. Additionally, the project has released a new SpotlightFS that is like the Finder&#8217;s SmartFolders, but these work from the command line! Way cool.
