Like, say, the Python Cheeseshop. I&#8217;ve been using Python eggs extensively since mid-2005 and have grown used to how easy it is to easy\_install &#8220;random package&#8221;. Lately, I&#8217;ve been using zc.buildout to get entire environments set up, and it&#8217;s Cheeseshop dependent in the same way that easy\_install is.

Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s been involved with coding and running the Cheeseshop. It&#8217;s a great resource!

Now can we have it back, please? ðŸ™‚
