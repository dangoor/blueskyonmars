Today, I sent out an announcement to zope-dev and jython-dev regarding Web Elite&#8217;s [phabric][1] open source project. We&#8217;re using Jython to get Zope running on Java. We&#8217;ve been working on it for a little while now, but some recent discussions on jython-dev prompted us to announce the project before it&#8217;s done.
