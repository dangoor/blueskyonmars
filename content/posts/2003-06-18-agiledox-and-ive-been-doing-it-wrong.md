Joe Walnes writes about [Agiledox][1], and the first tool Testdox. Testdox creates documentation from unit test method names. More often than not, I&#8217;ve been naming my tests based on the method they are testing. This is sometimes descriptive, because I tend to write more small methods instead of fewer large methods. However, I like what Testdox does and the implications that has for using a TestCase as documentation for how to use a class.
