Apple issued their gleeful press release: [iTunes Music Store Sells Over One Million Songs in First Week][1]. Something that&#8217;s even more remarkable is that more than half of the 200,000 songs they carry were downloaded in the past week. I never would have expected that such a broad range would sell. These numbers are also interesting given that this service only works with Macs and iPods. I wonder if these AAC files will eventually work with my Nomad? I&#8217;m really wary of giving in to DRM though.
