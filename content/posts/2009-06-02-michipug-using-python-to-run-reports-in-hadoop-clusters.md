Zattoo&#8217;s Marshall Weir will be talking at this week&#8217;s MichiPUG (Thursday evening at 7PM at SRT Solutions in downtown Ann Arbor). In his own words:

> I&#8217;ve been working on a python module for running reports in Hadoop. Its sort of a wrapper around the pig data processing language and some smarts for running reports on a hadoop cluster and pushing and pulling data to it. It&#8217;s designed primarily to make it easier and more efficient to run complex sets of interdependent reports &#8211; I&#8217;ve been using it to do business reporting on our customer behavior at Zattoo.

This should be very interesting for folks like me who have never seen Hadoop in action!
