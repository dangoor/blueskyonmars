I kicked off the [Michigan Python Users Group][1] (MichiPUG) in September 2005, so this month&#8217;s meeting marks 4 years since the group began!

This month&#8217;s meeting is going to be one of our &#8220;topic free&#8221; meetings. Despite the lack of a topic, we never have trouble finding Python things to discuss. If you&#8217;re going to be around Ann Arbor Thursday evening and have a burning Python question, do stop in!

The meeting will be at 7pm at [SRT Solutions][2] in [downtown Ann Arbor][3]. Parking is free and easy next to City Hall a couple blocks north (on Ann St.).

This month, I am stepping aside as the de facto leader of the group. While I am still a Python fan and heavy user, my interests have branched out enough that I plan to devote my rather limited &#8220;user group time&#8221; elsewhere. Stay tuned for more on that soon. [Mark Ramm][4] will be taking over my duties as &#8220;the guy who sends the monthly &#8216;what&#8217;s our topic?&#8217; email message&#8221;.

I&#8217;m almost certainly going to be arriving late to tomorrow&#8217;s meeting, but I do hope to catch up with folks for drinks afterwards at the very least! See you there!
