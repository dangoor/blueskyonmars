[A Whole Lotta Nothing][1] has an article about [The Future of Music][2]. In the article, Matthew Haughey writes about how MP3s are what people want and use, but the record companies still insist on pitching products that people don&#8217;t want, at prices people are not willing to pay. I think he&#8217;s right about how an enterprising artist or set of artists will eventually break away and make a good living selling MP3s of their music&#8230; but it will take a bit of a mental shift on the part of consumers, because they&#8217;re used to getting their MP3s for free from Napster, Morpheus and MP3.com.
