In a couple of weeks, I&#8217;ll be starting in on my new business. In addition to being a businessman, I&#8217;m a programmer. (Of course, I&#8217;m also the janitor for my new business ðŸ™‚ One thing I&#8217;m not is an artist.

Making a modern piece of software requires at least decent taste, if not the actual ability to make good, appropriate visuals from scratch. The 80&#215;24 text mode days are long gone. Luckily, there&#8217;s Slashdot to the rescue with [Art Tips For Programmers?][1]. The discussion thread includes all of the usually /. nonsense (I call BS!). It also includes a number of useful tips and links&#8230; like: use students from your [local university][2], but don&#8217;t abuse them. And don&#8217;t count on them to finish on time. Or, just use professionals, because they&#8217;re worth the money. Surprisingly, no one said &#8220;outsource the graphics work to Russia&#8221;. Like any /. thread, there are plenty of opinions and options, and I&#8217;ll have to figure out the right one to use in a couple of months.

In the meantime, though, I wanted to keep track of some of the handy links that appeared in the discussion.

  * [KDE-Look][3] has icon collections, many of which are LGPL or other useful license</a>
  * [InterfaceLIFT][4] has collections of stock icons
  * Not surprisingly, so does [StockIcons.com][5].
  * [Aquatint][6] gives any image that friendly Mac Aqua glow
  * The [Color Scheme Generator][7] is a web-based doodad that provides assistance for folks who don&#8217;t have a good sense of color coordination.
  * If stock photos is your thing (and I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s mine&#8230;), [stock.xchng][8] provides free stock photos. I wonder how dilligent they are about copyright clearance? Even if they aren&#8217;t, it would probably be unlikely that someone would notice.
  * Microsoft provides a detailed guide for [creating Win XP icons][9]. This includes colors to use, angles of images, sizes, etc.
  * A couple of people raved about [Drawing With The Right Side Of Your Brain][10]. While I will certainly admit that the &#8220;after&#8221; pictures in the gallery are technically far superior to the before pictures, they all look rather grim and scary. Still, if you&#8217;re looking to pick up drawing yourself, it would appear that this will help you with light and dark rendering and picking up detail in images.

Update: At least 100 of you probably saw the crazy initial posting. I fixed the odd cut and paste thing that had happened. Also, Chris Sterritt writes in:

> For whatever it&#8217;s worth, the book is named &#8220;Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain&#8221;. It was a book before it was a website :-). I kind of agree about the images on the website (they seem to all overemphasize the lines around the eyes)&#8230; the ones in the book are more appealing.
