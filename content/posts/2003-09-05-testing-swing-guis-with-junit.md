William C. Wake wrote an article way back in January 2000 about [unit testing Swing GUIs with JUnit.][1] No other package required. I&#8217;m not particular about unit testing the _layout_ of the frames, but writing unit tests to ensure that things work functionally (you click button A and result B happens) seems worthwhile.
