[Magnatune][1] is an experimental record label that offers music for download at $5-18 per album (you pick the price you think is fair). They split the proceeds 50/50 with the artists. All music is released under a Creative Commons license which allows sharing and derivative works as long as it&#8217;s non-commercial and attribution is given. It&#8217;s great to see such experiments, and I&#8217;d love to see an artist become a breakaway success from something like this.
