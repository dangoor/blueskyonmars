There are all sorts of opinions floating around. [This one, from Muqtedar Khan of Adrian College][1] is interesting because it is by a Muslim. I&#8217;m certain that there are many Muslims who disagree with him. I think he&#8217;s right that bad things can happen anywhere in the world and people can choose to read meaning into those things and lay blame where they choose.

It&#8217;s better to try to figure out why the bad things are happening and what can be done to correct them, locally if possible. (It doesn&#8217;t make sense for people to count on the US to take care of internal struggles&#8230; the US will only take care of some country&#8217;s internal struggle if it is in the US&#8217; interests.)
