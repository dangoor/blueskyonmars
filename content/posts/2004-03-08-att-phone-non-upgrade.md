I received a card in the mail from AT&T Wireless, my cellular company, saying that they&#8217;re sending me a Sony Ericsson T226 to replace my T68i free of charge. I thought &#8220;gee, that&#8217;s cool&#8221;. Turns out that it&#8217;s <a title="Slashdot | AT&T Wireless Phone "Upgrades" Aren't" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/03/07/1919230&mode=thread">not really cool at all</a>. The new phone has fewer features (no Bluetooth!). The advantage offered is better reception. A number of people commented that they switched to T-Mobile and happily got better reception and a better phone. I think I&#8217;ll call AT&T and see if they can offer me a better phone than the T226.
