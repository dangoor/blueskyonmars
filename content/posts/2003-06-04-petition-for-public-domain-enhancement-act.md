One of the most important champions for realistic law in the Internet age, [Lawrence Lessig][1], has started a petition for the Public Domain Enhancement Act. I think this act is very reasonable:

> That act would require American copyright holders to pay $1 fifty years after a work was published. If they pay the $1, the copyright continues. If they don&#8217;t, the work passes into the public domain.
