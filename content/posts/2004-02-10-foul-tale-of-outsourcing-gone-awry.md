As seen on [Slashdot][1]. A [government agency exposed sensitive day-care data][2] on the Net. This data included the schedules of hundreds of children. The data was posted to RentACoder for programming assistance. Why wasn&#8217;t this data treated more sensitively?

> County attorney David Morris said that programming work for the day-care center had been outsourced to the locally-based Genesee Community College. The manager of the college&#8217;s program refused to speak to a reporter, but Morris said Dennis was a third party consultant hired by Genesee. Dennis, in turn, used RentACoder to once again subcontract the database work, which ultimately fell to a New Jersey-based programmer.

Makes you think of the whole Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan thing (Tonya asks Jeff who asks some guy to ask some other guy to go after Nancy). When you&#8217;re that far removed from the actual customer involved, it&#8217;s hard to imagine getting the same results as someone who deals directly with the customer. People seem to care a bit more when they get directly involved&#8230; add three levels of indirection and you&#8217;ll be lucky to get something that runs.
