My state is [moving to the forefront of anti-spam legislation][1]:

> Modeling itself on a federal bill that would create a national spam opt-out list, the Michigan Senate passed what one member described as the nation&#8217;s toughest antispam bill.

Unfortunately, I think that antispam legislation, particularly at the state level, is probably about as productive as trying to stop P2P systems. The more productive use of effort would be to implement newer technical measures, difficult though they may be.
