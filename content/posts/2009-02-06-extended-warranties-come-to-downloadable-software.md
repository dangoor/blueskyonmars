You know those extended warranties that they always try to sell you at electronics (and other) stores? Remarkably, the concept has just been applied to downloadable software!

[What Is eDS?][1]

> eSellerate Download Service (eDS) is an extended download service that you can purchase to protect all downloadable software in your order. With eDS, you will be able to re-download exact copies of the software you purchased, for a period of 1 (one) year after the date of purchase.

It looks like they charge 5% for this service. Wow. Isn&#8217;t it a better idea to just have backups?
