Ian Landsman is right on in [4 Rules for the Practical Entrepreneur][1]. This is a must-read for anyone considering making the jump to being a software product freelancer. Falling into Ian&#8217;s &#8220;visionary&#8221; category is fine as long as you know what you&#8217;re getting into.

With Zesty News, I broke one of Ian&#8217;s rules: it&#8217;s a consumer product. Kinda. It appeals to both business and consumer users, so the question then becomes one of marketing and how you draw the business users in. I&#8217;ll be writing more about Zesty News soon (believe it or not).

With TurboGears, it&#8217;s hard to even draw parallels with the kind of thing you just &#8220;go off and start&#8221;. I&#8217;m forging off into some new territory (for me) and it&#8217;ll be interesting to see where I end up.
