This popped up a few days back. Rich Sheridan of Ann Arbor&#8217;s own Menlo Innovations was on the cover of Forbes ([Forbes.com: Accidental Entrepreneur][1])! The article is both a bit grim and inspirational. It&#8217;s inspirational in that some of the stories they tell, including Rich&#8217;s, are of people who had good success _after_ losing their jobs. On the grim side, they talk about the fairly large number of people getting laid off and the difficulty of getting a business going in this economy.
