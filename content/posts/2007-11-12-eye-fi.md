Working on cool stuff with great people is the ideal, right? Check it out. There&#8217;s this most unusual product called the [Eye-Fi][1], which combines an SD card with built-in wifi. What this means is that you can shoot pictures with your digital camera and have them uploaded to your computer and Flickr (etc) wirelessly, _without doing anything_. Bam! They just beam over. How cool is that?

Even cooler to know that [my new company][2] was [involved in the Eye-Fi&#8217;s creation][3]. Follow that link to learn a bit about how the Eye-Fi is set up. This is definitely a new way to do UI for a tiny standalone device like this.
