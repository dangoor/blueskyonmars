cmd.exe on Windows sucks. Cygwin and MinGW aren&#8217;t _really_ Windows (though they are certainly better and cygwin is what I use). So, I ask the lazyweb: is there a better command line for Windows? It looks like the company that made 4DOS ([JPSoft][1]) is still around and makes better command lines. They&#8217;re not entirely cheap though. Are there any free choices?

Seems like this would be a good Python project, given the tools for making Python command prompts and the excellent Windows integration that&#8217;s available.
