Brad Neuberg on his [new HTML5 slide deck][1]:

> I&#8217;ve created a 3D slide deck that uses HTML5, CSS3, and a bit of SVG ([video][2]). The main idea behind this deck is to be able to &#8216;zoom&#8217; into topics to as deep a level as necessary. Slides are nested, like an outline. 

The last presentation I did was also HTML5, using [dzslides][3]. The ability to dive deep into topics or skip over is a really cool feature of Brad&#8217;s slides.
