Yesterday, I was working in Photoshop and got a simple image looking the way I wanted it to. I had eyedroppered the color from a different file. Whenever I tried to edit in Image Ready or save for the web, the image became distinctly lighter. It would seem that this interestingly formatted page has the reason: [Save For Web Color Shift ImageReady][1]. As of now, I&#8217;m still seeing the color change when I move from Photoshop to ImageReady, so the tips presented there have not yet borne fruit for me.

A major issue here for me is that I&#8217;m trying to synchronize the color in the image with an HTML color. Photoshop tells me the correct HTML color code, but ImageReady is producing a different color.
