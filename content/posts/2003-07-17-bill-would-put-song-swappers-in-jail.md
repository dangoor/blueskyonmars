This doesn&#8217;t even really need comment&#8230; [Bill Would Put Internet Song Swappers in Jail][1]:

> The Conyers-Berman bill would operate under the assumption that each copyrighted work made available through a computer network was copied by others at least 10 times for a total retail value of $2,500. That would bump the activity from a misdemeanor to a felony, carrying a sentence of up to five years in jail.
