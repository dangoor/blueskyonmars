In just a few weeks, I&#8217;ll be giving a talk at the [Adobe MAX conference][1] about extending [Brackets][2] with JavaScript. Web developers will find that Brackets is pretty easy to extend using techniques they already know. That&#8217;s probably why there are [a lot of Brackets extensions already][3].

People who come to [my session][4] will learn how to build Brackets extensions. I plan to have plenty of code samples drawn from real extensions.

If you&#8217;re interested in attending, you can still [register][5]. Use the code MXSM13 to save $300. (Note also that a MAX pass comes with 1 year of Creative Cloud, which gives you access to a huge amount of software and services.)

If you do come to MAX, definitely find me and say hi!
