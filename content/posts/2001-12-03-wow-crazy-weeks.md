This has been a crazy few weeks. Lots of time spent with family and friends (which is nice). Lots of time spent at work over the past few days&#8230; but now, I&#8217;ve got a week off. After deciding that I prefer working at a company that is not built around custom work, I&#8217;ve left Web Elite. Next week, I start at [CareerSite][1], which has great potential and a great offering already.

This week will be a good chance to catch up on things&#8230; Like this blog. I still owe Dries a patch for Drupal that fixes Drupal for php4.0.4pl1.
