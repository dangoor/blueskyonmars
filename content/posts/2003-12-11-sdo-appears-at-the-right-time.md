[James Strachan&#8217;s Radio Weblog][1] pointed me in the direction of IBM and BEA&#8217;s new [Service Data Object (SDO)][2] specs. By strange coincidence, I stumbled across this today and I&#8217;m having a meeting tomorrow to discuss an API that has some things in common with SDO. It would be beneficial for us to use SDO rather than reinventing the wheel. In fact, had SDO existed some months back, some of the other things we&#8217;ve developed may have been different.
