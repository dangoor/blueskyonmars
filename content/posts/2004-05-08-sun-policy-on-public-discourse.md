Tim Bray helped to create the [Sun Policy on Public Discourse][1]. This is an interesting document and is probably a good fit for nearly any company. Some of it seems like common sense, but it&#8217;s often better to explicitly state such things, if you&#8217;re going to bother to write a policy about it.

As more companies deal with bloggers and the effect bloggers can have on the public perception of the company, a policy like this can make a good template for others to think about when creating their own.
