Previously, I wrote about a form you can fill out for the [Direct Marketing Association][1] to get off of random junk mail mailing lists. It&#8217;s been three months since I sent that in, and I have recently noticed a significant drop in the number of credit card applications arriving. In short, it works! If you want to reduce your incoming real life spam, just write to the DMA. (Of course, this only applies in the US. I can only hope that folks in other countries aren&#8217;t plagued by the huge number of credit card apps that arrive here.)
