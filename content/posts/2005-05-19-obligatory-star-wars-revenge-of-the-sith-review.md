Today, the [boss][1] let me sneak out and see [Star Wars, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith][2]. I saw a 1:30PM show and it was busy, but certainly not crazy. There were a couple people with lightsabers and robes, but that was about as nuts as it gets on a Thursday afternoon in Michigan.

Short form review: I thought the movie was excellent. Yes, Lucas is not a good writer and, yes, the acting can be a bit stiff at times. But, the story of how Anakin becomes Vader was much more credible than I expected. The movie was plotted, paced and shot very well. All-in-all, Episode III did deliver on all of that exposition from the first two movies and makes Star Wars a fairly seamless 6 parter.

Spoiler that you don&#8217;t care about alert.

Jar Jar Binks does _not_ die in this movie. Though he&#8217;s basically one of the good guys (despite the fact that he basically created the Empire in Episode II when he moved to grant special powers to Palpatine), he&#8217;s not a Jedi and so he survives. Alas, you can&#8217;t have everything.
