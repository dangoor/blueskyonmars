I&#8217;m pleased to announce the first release of [TGWebServices][1], a multiprotocol web services toolkit for TurboGears. TGWebServices hooks up straightforward Python methods in an easily consumed API supporting SOAP, HTTP+XML and HTTP+JSON. &#8220;Easily consumed&#8221; means that it works well even with statically typed languages.

Thanks to [Arbor Networks][2] for letting me release this work. (p.s. we&#8217;re hiring!). Thanks also to [WebFaction][3] for hosting the TGWebServices project.
