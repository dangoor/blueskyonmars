George W. Bush&#8217;s approval rating is just a shade above EPIC FAIL. As much as he&#8217;d like to claim to be an agent of change, McCain&#8217;s policies are much, much closer to GWB&#8217;s than he&#8217;d like to admit. If this election was all about the issues, McCain would lose, of that I have no doubt.

So, rather than campaigning on the issues, John McCain has thrown all integrity out the window. He&#8217;s building a campaign on lies and stupid non-issues. He&#8217;s chosen a running mate based on political motivations rather than ability to lead this country should something happen to him. (Actuaries would certainly argue that something is more likely to happen to McCain than to Obama.)

For his part, Obama has exaggerated a bit and used negative campaigning. From what I have seen Obama has not stooped to outright lying, and I sincerely hope he doesn&#8217;t start. Thank goodness for FactCheck.org, because that site really helps keep things on the level. I wish all voters would follow that site.

Obama is not a perfect candidate, nor is he running on a perfect platform. But, to me, McCain/Palin sounds every bit as bad as Bush/Cheney. Earlier this year, I didn&#8217;t think so. I thought that McCain was a man of honor and would be a step up from GWB. After a week of lies and lipstick, McCain has shown what he&#8217;s truly made of. A vote for McCain/Palin is a vote for FAIL.

For people not in swing states, it&#8217;s worth checking out what Ron Paul and Bob Barr are up to. Ron Paul has real reform in mind, rather than &#8220;change&#8221; as a slogan. If you are in a swing state (as I am), vote Obama for a chance at something better than we&#8217;ve had for the past 8 years.
