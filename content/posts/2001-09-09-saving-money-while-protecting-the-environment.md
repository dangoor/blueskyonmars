This NY Times article about companies [saving money while protecting the environment][1] is great to see. Generally, environmentally friendly policies are thought of as more expensive. (Nevermind the fact that we all need to live on this planet and people should be reasonable about these things.) But, it&#8217;s great to see that companies can realize monetary _and_ karmic benefits at the same time.
