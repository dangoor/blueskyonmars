Bush repeated his call to drill for oil in Alaska, in order to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. To which I say: why not reduce our dependence on oil, period? He said that drilling in Alaska will create jobs&#8230; putting money into alternative energy sources can also create jobs. I guess we can&#8217;t expect anything else from someone who&#8217;s grown up with oil and whose campaign was significantly assisted by oil and big energy money.
