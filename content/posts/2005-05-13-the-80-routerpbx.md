Though I have yet to install anything unusual on my Linksys WRT54G, I got that particular model specifically because I knew you _could_ install other stuff if you wanted to. Some folks have figured out how to turn this little router (I think I only paid $50 for mine) into [a PBX!][1] Yes, you can have your very own configurable telephone system for very little cash.
