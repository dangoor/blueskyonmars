I have this site configured to allow comments even on the older posts. I&#8217;ve had a little bit of comment spam, but I&#8217;ve also noticed that a couple of posts in particular have continued to get comments.

[India&#8217;s President Talks Up Open Source][1] appeared in May of last year. Since then, new comments have appeared in August, November, December, January and again today. And the comments are _weird_. They&#8217;re kinda spam-like, but kinda not. Since they aren&#8217;t linking to spammy sorts of sites, I&#8217;ve left them there for your enjoyment.

Another one is my post about [Super Volcanoes][2] that came along in August 2001, when this site was still We Write Online. Up until recently, this article was in the first page of matches for &#8220;super volcanoes&#8221; on Google. So, starting in July 2003, people started coming along and asking me, apparently the authority on super volcanoes, questions about them. The last comment was in September 2003, but I think I&#8217;ve also had a couple of other, somewhat childish ones that I&#8217;ve had to delete.

The randomness of people that come to my blog is certainly one of the more enjoyable parts of blogging.
