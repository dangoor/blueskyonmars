When I read about XCode 2.1, this kind of bubbled just under my conciousness. Slashdot brought it fully to my attention, though. Apple has made [WebObjects][1] free with Tiger. (Not open source, though&#8230;)

I read a bit about WebObjects in 2003 while doing some research for a new project. Though I have seen some folks complain that Apple has let the software languish, I&#8217;ve seen some of these same folks say it&#8217;s the best way to build a webapp.

It looks very cool, and apparently is Java-based in its current incarnation. So, you can develop on a Mac and deploy on a Linux box, if you wish. You can deploy to a J2EE app server or use Apple&#8217;s own server with J2SE 1.3.1+.

The trick, though, is that I can&#8217;t find anything about the deployment terms on Apple&#8217;s site. Their &#8220;Flexible, low-cost licensing&#8221;:

> Requires only one license per machine, regardless of platform, speed, or number of processors

But \*how much does it cost\*? I didn&#8217;t see anything in the Apple Store and the WO front page tries to get you to buy Mac OS X Server.

(It&#8217;s kind of funny ending an article with a title that says that something is free by asking how much it costs&#8230;)
