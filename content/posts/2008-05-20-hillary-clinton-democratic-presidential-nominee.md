That may be true, though I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s counting Michigan and Florida despite the fact that Michigan didn&#8217;t even have Obama on the ballot. So it&#8217;s actually &#8220;if we had the same rules as the Republicans and if I hadn&#8217;t agreed to punish the states that went early.&#8221;

Hillary has had to continually come up with new kinds of math to reason as to why she is still going. I&#8217;d like to offer up an approach she hasn&#8217;t taken yet:

That&#8217;s her current, pre-Kentucky, delegate tally from CNN.com. When written like that, if you kind of squint at it a bit, it looks like 2753 which very comfortably gives her the nomination. Congrats, Hillary!

p.s. to Hillary fans: I would undoubtedly vote for Hillary over McCain, if that were the choice. I just believe that dealing in &#8220;if-only&#8221; scenarios and continuing to waste money (money that could otherwise go toward the general election) on a campaign that is doomed to fail just weakens the democratic party. After today, Obama will only be about 50 delegates away from the nomination.
