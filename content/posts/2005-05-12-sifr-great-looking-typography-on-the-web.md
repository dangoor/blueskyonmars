Wow. No, I mean _wow_. [SIFR][1], an LGPLed combination of JavaScript, CSS and Flash, let&#8217;s you easily use _any font_ for text on your pages, regardless of whether the user has the font. It leaves your pages fully accessible and searchable, and it drops and and removes very easily. Look at the [example page][2] to see the kind of coolness I&#8217;m talking about.
