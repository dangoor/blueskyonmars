File this under &#8220;pricey but cool&#8221;: [Picture It Postage][1] lets you get real postage stamps with a picture straight from your iPhoto library. They charge approximately $0.50 extra per stamp ($16.95 for 20 $0.37 stamps), but it is reallly spiffy for a special occasion. I gather that there are other services like this, but this is the first I&#8217;ve heard of it.
