The September meeting of the [Michigan Python Users Group (MichiPUG)][1] is coming up on Thursday, September 4. This meeting marks the third birthday of the group!

[Titus Brown][2] will be presenting to us on a [Python Software Foundation][3]-related project, as well as some of the things he has going on in his classes at Michigan State University. If you&#8217;re taking one of Titus&#8217; classes, this might be a good way to get a head start ðŸ™‚

The meeting is at 7PM at the [SRT Solutions][4] office in downtown Ann Arbor (corner of Fifth and Washington).
