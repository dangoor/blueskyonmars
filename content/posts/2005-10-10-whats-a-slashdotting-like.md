A Slashdotting can be very interesting if the thing most slashdotters are looking at is an 80MB file. I have no idea how many people (if any) were served up by the [Coral][1] cache. I don&#8217;t know how many people downloaded the file via BitTorrent.

I can see a thing or two by looking at my access log, and speaking with Jason I got some other fun facts.

About twice as many people viewed the 20 Minute Wiki screencast today as they did in the previous 23 days. It looks like over 13,500 now. The screencast was using an alarming 80-95Mbps for quite a bit of the day. Apache reports that TextDrive served up more than 1.2 terabytes for me today. Wow! Thanks, TextDrive!

As of now, my server at GoDaddy has served up another 67GB. Bob Ippolito has once again stepped up with capacity, this time on two different servers. Charlie Moad also provided a server. So, the load is now split up among four servers, which helps us all out I think.

As I write this, there are still quite a few people watching, so I&#8217;m guessing we&#8217;ll tack on another 1,000 views by morning.

Thanks to the folks who kept all of turbogears.org up and available for the whole day!
