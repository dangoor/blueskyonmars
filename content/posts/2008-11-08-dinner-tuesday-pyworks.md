My flight to PyWorks arrives around 6:20pm on Tuesday, and I anticipate needing dinner after I get to the hotel. Anyone want to meet up for dinner there?

**Update:** I may not be coming in on Tuesday after all. We&#8217;ve got some illnesses going around in the family, so it&#8217;s looking like I&#8217;ll come in on Wednesday.

**Update 2:** I&#8217;m coming in today after all.
