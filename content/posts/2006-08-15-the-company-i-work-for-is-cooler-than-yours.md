The release notes for [Arbor Peakflow SP][1] mention &#8220;Zombie army detection&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure that was written with a straight face. Still, not many companies can list that as a feature of their product. Imagine a car: the new Chevy Impaler with Zombie Army Detection and BrainChaff (courtesy of [Brains4Zombies][2]) protects you and your family from the zombie armies that are just waiting to attack.

The botnet and zombie army detection features of Peakflow SP are actually quite useful, but it is still a fun thing to see in print.
