Former WorldCom (MCI) CFO Scott Sullivan has pleaded guilty to the criminal charges against him that were involved in the $11 billion accounting game they played. Additionally, [Attorney General John Ashcroft is to Announce Charges Against Ex-WorldCom CEO][1], Bernie Ebbers. Ebbers has generally claimed innocence in all of this, so we&#8217;ll see in court how much knowledge he actually had of all of this. It&#8217;s hard to imagine a CEO not knowing about $11 billion in misdirected accounting. I worked for WorldCom for a couple of years, after WorldCom acquired ANS from AOL.
