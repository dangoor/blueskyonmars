There have been lots of programs along the way that claim to speed up browsing. However, not many people can offer a 100,000 computer network with tons of bandwidth to speed up your surfing. That&#8217;s where Google comes in with their [web accelerator][1]. The basic idea is that Google is already caching copies of web pages, so they&#8217;ll take those cached copies and send them to you more quickly than the original servers could. They also do prefetching of pages, compression and other tricks to speed up general surfing.

Sadly, it&#8217;s only Windows at this point. (But it at least works with [a decent browser][2]). Modem users need not apply, as this will likely just make your modem explode.
