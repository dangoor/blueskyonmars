The Server Side is presenting [The Naked Object Architecture Series][1], which is an interesting comparison of the Naked Objects approach vs. a standard Swing approach. The discussion attached to the link is also interesting.

I have had a tendency to think that using a generated UI would not be as productive for our users as a custom-tuned, task-oriented UI. The Naked Objects folks have some more info coming up about this topic, so I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye out for that.
