[MICHIPUG][1] (the Michigan Python Users Group) will be meeting on a special day for October: Tuesday, October 3rd. The meeting will be at 7PM as usual, at the Arbor Networks office in downtown Ann Arbor, as the September meeting was.

We changed the day so that Titus Brown, author of Twill, could come and talk about testing topics with us. We&#8217;re hoping that Jason Pellerin, author of Nose, will also be there.

In addition to Titus&#8217; talk, we also have Bruce Webber talking about wxPython.

Quite a meeting lined up! I hope to see you there!
