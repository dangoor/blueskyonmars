The [Eudibamus Project from Fraunhofer FIRST][1] is an integration of SnipSnap and Eclipse to allow developers to create links (in both directions, I believe) between code and documentation. I wonder how it integrates with CVS, since the documentation would ideally be shared as well&#8230; Sounds like something that is worth a further look!
