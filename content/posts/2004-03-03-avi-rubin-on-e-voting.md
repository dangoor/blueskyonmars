Famed crypotographer and CS geek Avi Rubin wrote a fascinating essay about his [day as an election judge][1]. Rubin has been very critical of the security surrounding e-voting systems, and Diebold&#8217;s systems in particular. He was a judge in a precinct using Diebold systems. He concluded that while some attacks he was concerned about are not possible, the potential for massive fraud is still far too great and is a real threat to our democracy.
