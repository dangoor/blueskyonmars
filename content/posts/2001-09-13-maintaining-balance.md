There is an article about [American Muslims going on the defensive][1]. I do hope that people maintain perspective through this. Someone on CNN made the point that &#8220;there are 1 billion Muslims in the world, and we&#8217;re not at war with them&#8221;. There is a small radical faction that we need to be concerned about, and we should think no differently of our Muslim and Arab friends today than we did at the beginning of the week.
