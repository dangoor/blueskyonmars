The Register [has retracted][1] Monday&#8217;s story about the RIAA calling for tougher laws. Everything in the original article, including the quotes, was a hoax. The attitudes portrayed in that message seemed close enough to reality that many people (including myself) were taken in. The quotes said the things that many of us believe that the RIAA members feel.

That, of course, is no excuse for misrepresenting people, so I&#8217;m happy to see that The Register has posted a satire-free, humble retraction.
