[Slashdot | Macropayments: ISPs pay Content Providers for Access][1]: _&#8220;They report that the swedish company (Tric AB) will &#8220;act as a third party between ISP&#8217;s and content-suppliers with the intent to let the content-suppliers get a share of the access-income. It will act as a clearinghouse where the income from the ISP&#8217;s is distributed to different content-suppliers in relation to size and traffic&#8221;.&#8221;_ This kind of move will make net access like cable access&#8230;

you subscribe to &#8220;basic&#8221; service to get access to the basic net, and then other packages. I could foresee a sports package that includes sites like ESPN.com. Luckily, this is a voluntary sort of system. If you want to make a free site (like this one!), no one will stop you.
