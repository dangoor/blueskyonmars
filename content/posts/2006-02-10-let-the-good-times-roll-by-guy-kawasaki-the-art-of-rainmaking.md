Guy Kawasaki&#8217;s blog is fantasic. Really great reading (and only a month old!) One recent entry: [The Art of Rainmaking][1] stresses some great points about selling your product. His writing here is focused on selling some goods and getting some cash, but many of his points are applicable to selling _anything_: ideas, open source tools, etc.
