Based on the one bit of feedback and my own intuition, I have changed my categorization and feeds. You&#8217;ll now see three feeds available on the left:

  * **All** &#8211; yes, you get all of my random blatherings about politics, music and whatnot.
  * **Python** &#8211; Brand new feed designed for folks interested in Python. Also includes general Software Development articles (these would be process and technique related), and Software Business articles.
  * **Java** &#8211; A new Java category will hold any links to Java-related goodies that I talk about. This feed also carries the Software Development and Software Business articles.

For those of you reading those feeds, the only reason you would need to change something on your end is if you want the new Python category and are not subscribed to all.
