[F-Script][1] is a Smalltalk dialect for Mac OS X. Clearly, many in the Mac community are already aware of F-Script, since it won an Innovators Award in 2003. I&#8217;d imagine many are always aware of [F-Script Anywhere][2], which allows you to attach F-Script to any Mac OS X program. I wasn&#8217;t aware of this until yesterday, so I just had to say &#8220;wow! that&#8217;s cool!&#8221;.

Using F-Script Anywhere, you&#8217;ve got an object browser that you can use to poke around at the various objects in a running program, sending messages and getting responses back. Within a couple minutes of download F-Script Anywhere, I was able to send JavaScript commands to my running Safari window. Mac OS X has the coolest software architecture around.

Speaking of the Mac OS X software architecture, Apple has an open source package called [Core Foundation Lite][3], which provides a number of the base classes used in Cocoa development. I knew that Mac OS X&#8217;s kernel was open source, but I didn&#8217;t realize that some of the framework code was also open source. CFLite is still quite low-level, but it is a way to move some code between platforms.
