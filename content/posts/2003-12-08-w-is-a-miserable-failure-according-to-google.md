I wonder if the White House will pressure Google to change this. As reported by the BBC, a [Google search for &#8220;miserable failure&#8221;][1] [links to Bush&#8217;s bio on whitehouse.gov][2]. Unless weblogs tilt the balance in favor of the BBC article, [miserable failure][3] will probably point to Bush&#8217;s page until the end of his term. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Republican activities try to reorient the term elsewhere.
