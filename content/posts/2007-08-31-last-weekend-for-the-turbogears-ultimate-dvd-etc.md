About a month ago, I mentioned that the [TurboGears Ultimate DVD][1] and my other TG merchandise (MarbleGears and the toolboxes) were on clearance. I&#8217;ve reduced the prices a little more and set Monday as the last day for sales of the goods. Now is your last chance! The stuff is cheap, and I&#8217;d be happy if my fulfillment company has less stuff to send back to me ðŸ™‚
