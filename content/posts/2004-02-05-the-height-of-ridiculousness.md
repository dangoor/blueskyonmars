Personally, I think the whole &#8220;Janet Jackson Superbowl&#8221; thing is overblown. I wish America would take a cue from Europe: be more critical of violence on TV than sex and nudity. Regardless of what one thinks of the Super Bowl spectacle, not [allowing JC Chasez to perform at the Pro Bowl][1] is just downright crazy.

> Due to the controversy caused by the Justin Timberlake-Janet Jackson boobgate, the NFL has decided to cancel a halftime performance by Timberlake&#8217;s fellow &#8216;N Syncer, JC Chasez, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed to E! Wednesday.

That&#8217;s bizarre. That&#8217;s like saying that they wouldn&#8217;t let Michael Jackson perform because he&#8217;s Janet&#8217;s brother. I went to a Janet Jackson concert in 1990, so I guess I&#8217;d never be able to perform at an NFL event either.
