In Python, we&#8217;ve been enjoying the convenience of mixing and matching various things that follow the WSGI convention for a while. More recently, [Rack][1] brought those good features to a very similar interface for Ruby. And now I see:

[Jack: Rack for JavaScript][2]

> echo &#8220;Rack provides an minimal interface between webservers supporting Ruby and Ruby frameworks&#8221; | sed -e s/Rack/Jack/g -e s/Ruby/JavaScript/g 

Jack comes from Tom Robinson, one of the developers of Cappuccino/Objective-J.
