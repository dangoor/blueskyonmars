[JavaScrypt: Browser-Based Cryptography Tools][1] actually seems like a useful project. I&#8217;ve been looking for a convenient, cross-platform encryption system to encrypt my silly website password list. (I had been using a Windows-based system, but I spend a lot of time using a Mac now). This seems handy, because I&#8217;ll always have a browser available&#8230; and I should be able to only save the encrypted file to disk.
