Not that I do &#8220;quotes of the day&#8221; generally, but here&#8217;s a great one. A recurring theme in Seth Godin&#8217;s work is that you have to be different and not [just be a cog in someone else&#8217;s machine][1].

> The end result is that it&#8217;s essentially impossible to become successful or well off doing a job that is described and measured by someone else.
