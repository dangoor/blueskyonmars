The NY Times presents an excellent 8 page article on [low fat not being all it&#8217;s cracked up to be][1]. Personally, I don&#8217;t have a weight or cholesterol problem at this point in my life, so I haven&#8217;t been worried about dieting. But I have been living with the indoctrination that a low-fat diet is the right kind of diet for a long time&#8230;

and now we start to see evidence that maybe fat is not the real problem. Given what this article says, I probably eat way too many carbs. Everything in moderation is probably the best policy.
