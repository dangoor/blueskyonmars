So sayeth the great fortune cookie. Possibly apropos, given that I&#8217;m starting a new business. But, who doesn&#8217;t have plans that the can keep secret for now? Besides, I _want_ to blog the business building as it progresses. Helps keep me from forgetting things that might be interesting, if not useful, to remember later.
