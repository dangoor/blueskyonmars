I should&#8217;ve blogged this the other day. I did a yum update, and BAM! mysql disappeared. So, I guess [these instructions for upgrading MySQL on FC3][1] are not entirely flawless. However, they did do the job of getting MySQL 4.1 running. It just didn&#8217;t survive an update. If you&#8217;re looking to get it running for yourself, these steps will do the trick.
