Joshua Marinacci rounded out his three part series on making a native-feeling Swing app. In the third part, he talks about [adding icons, compressing the finished product and adding a splash screen][1]. A most excellent tutorial that may even lead to some better looking Swing apps. I&#8217;ve actually noticed a bit of an uptick recently in decent Swing apps, since I started using a Mac. When you look for alternatives to Windows apps, you sometimes find some really nice ones.
