Slashdot is reporting that [Sir Mix-A-Lot is using Weed to distribute music][1]. [Weed][2] is a rather nifty sounding DRM/file-sharing combo that lets you preview music. If you buy it and share it, you get a cut of the sales of your shared music. While I find DRM generally annoying, at least here is someone trying to do something truly innovative with it.
