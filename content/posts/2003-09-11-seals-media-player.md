The [Seal Player][1] offers access to a bunch of Seal music including all of his new Seal IV album. I&#8217;ll have to give this a listen later, because I like a fair amount of Seal&#8217;s earlier work. Apparently, this album is actually his 5th, because he created an entire album that he threw out before releasing this one.
