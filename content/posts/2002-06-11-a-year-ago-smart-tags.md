As a regular reader of [Scripting News][1], I find Dave Winer&#8217;s habit of looking back at previous writing to be quite interesting. That&#8217;s one of the cool things about blogs. It&#8217;s a space to keep your personal view of history. A year ago, techies were talking about Microsoft&#8217;s Smart Tags. Smart Tags got killed off in that incarnation, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they show up again.
