President Bush has taken the leap [and now endorses a Constitutional Amendment banning gay marriage][1]. As the article points out, amending the Constitution is difficult, so let&#8217;s hope that this doesn&#8217;t pass and put a black mark on our Constitution. I wonder if some of the gay marriage opponents think that legalized gay marriage will somehow mean that _their_ churches will be forced to marry gay couples. The US government can&#8217;t do that&#8230; the only marriage-related action the government can take is on a civil basis.
