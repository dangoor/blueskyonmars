JD [book tagged me][1]. Who am I to refuse a cool and useful meme like that?

**Total number of books I own**: Err, a lot&#8230; mostly from my younger days. There&#8217;s quite a bit of fantasy in there, a number of computer books (doubtless including quite a few that are marvelously out of date) and your random Grisham or Crichton.

**Last book I read**: Lately, I&#8217;ve been listening to some audiobooks and reading others in their typical dead-tree form. The last audiobook I completed was [The Return of the King][2] by J.R.R. Tolkien. I loved the movies so much, I figured it was finally time for me to get through the entire set of books. Rob Inglis does a _fantastic_ job reading these books, and they are unabridged.

**My unfinished books**: I&#8217;m not sure if this part is supposed to be books that I never finished and never will, or books that I&#8217;m in the middle of now. I&#8217;ve got three books in play right now: [The Last Juror][3] by John Grisham (audio book), [Call To Action][4] by Bryan and Jeffrey Eisenberg, and [Negotiating Your Salary][5] by Jack Chapman. I bought Call To Action based on [Seth Godin&#8217;s][6] recommendation, given that I need to build a persuasive site for [Zesty News][7] before the full version is released. So far, it&#8217;s interesting but not earth-shattering. I&#8217;m only 70 pages in, so I hope that changes.

_Books that mean a lot to me_: (in no particular order)

[Getting Things Done][8] &#8211; I&#8217;m with JD on this one. This book presents a simple mindset to follow to be able to get things done and not be overwhelmed.

[Dragonlance][9] (the first 6 books) &#8211; One of my favorite fantasy stories ever. This is responsible for the &#8220;tazzzzz&#8221; moniker that you see on me at times (which is a multi-year bastardization of Tasslehoff Burrfoot). This eventually lead to the name &#8220;Kendermedia&#8221;, which was the previous business I started. Dragonlance is also the source of my daughter&#8217;s name, Crysania. The series has expanded to some gigantic number of books. If you like fantasy, give [Dragonlance Chronicles][10] and [Dragonlance Legends][11] a whirl.

A number of first three Piers Anthony books &#8211; In the same sci-fi/fantasy vein, I&#8217;ve enjoyed a number of books by the prolific Piers Anthony. It&#8217;s been a few years since I&#8217;ve read anything new by him. I&#8217;d recommend sticking to the first three books in his series, because he tends to fall off mightily after that. Choice picks (in order): [Split Infinity][12] (first in Apprentice Adept series), [On A Pale Horse][13] (first in the Incarnations of Immortality series), and [A Spell For Chameleon][14] (first in his silly, pun-filled and entertaining Xanth series).

[Bull&#8217;s Eye Investing][15] by John Mauldin &#8211; Have you noticed that the stock market as a whole hasn&#8217;t increased _at all_ since 2000? Five years with a 0% return. Ick. Want to know why? Read this book. While you&#8217;re at it, you can sign up for [John&#8217;s free newsletter][16] for an ongoing look at the econonomy.

[The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy][17] by Douglas Adams &#8211; Every now and then, an author appears who has a truly unique and entertaining style. Dr. Seuss comes to mind&#8230; and Douglas Adams does, too. &#8220;Almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea&#8221;. Lots of people try, but no one captures things in quite the same way as Douglas. Don&#8217;t let the movie influence your decision to read the book&#8230; just read it.

[Purple Cow][18] by Seth Godin &#8211; If you&#8217;re starting a business today, _you need to read this book_. Or listen to the [Purple Cow/Free Prize Inside][19] combined audio book as I did. The main premise is that you have to be different to get attention and that it&#8217;s less risky to do things in ways other than established convention. Seth Godin doesn&#8217;t just say that, though. He hammers the idea home with lots of great examples and gets you consciously thinking about how you&#8217;re going to make yourself stand out. I [reviewed the audio book][20] back in January.

[The Demon-Haunted World][21] by Carl Sagan &#8211; This book gives you a real appreciation for the scientific method. People invariably get things wrong the first time around, but the scientific method ensures that eventually things will get worked out. This book has a great look at [&#8220;pseudoscience&#8221;][22].

For software developers, I&#8217;d recommend [Joel On Software&#8230;][23] by [Joel Spolsky][24], which I read in web-form as it was being written. I&#8217;d also recommend [Extreme Programming Explained][25] by Kent Beck. Even if you&#8217;ve never done XP and have no desire to do so, grokking the ideas can only make you a better programmer.

I have no doubt that there are others that I&#8217;m neglecting, but these certainly made an impression since they came to mind without even looking at our bookshelves.

I&#8217;m passing the tag to:

  * [Dave Winer][26]
  * [Merlin Mann][27]
  * [David Heinemeier Hansson][28]

I would have tagged Ian, but he&#8217;s [already been tagged][29]. Similarly, Joel has already written [book reviews][30] that likely suffice for a book tag.
