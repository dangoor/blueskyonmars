[Randy E. Barnett on Supreme Court & Sodomy on National Review Online][1] writes:

> Contrary to what has been reported repeatedly in the press, the Court in Lawrence did not protect a &#8220;right of privacy.&#8221; Rather, it protected &#8220;liberty&#8221; â€” and without showing that the particular liberty in question is somehow fundamental.&#8221;

A [few days back][2], I pointed to an article that said that the Court had gone too far because they were overriding a law without referring to specific language in the Constitution. Barnett, on the other hand, says that the Court is actually taking a more straightforward approach to &#8220;liberty&#8221; and placing more onus on the government to demonstrate that an infringement on liberty is warranted.

I&#8217;m not a lawyer, so I can&#8217;t really comment sensibly on whether the Court is overstepping its bounds. I am all in favor of the government needing to prove that liberties are only taken away when absolutely necessary.
