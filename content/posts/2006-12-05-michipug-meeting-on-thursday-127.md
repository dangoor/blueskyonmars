The December [Michigan Python Users Group][1] meeting is coming up on Thursday, December 7th. As usual, it will be a 7PM at Arbor Networks (go to the michipug.org website for more info).

On the agenda for this meeting is a talk about Pyblosxom from Jim McDonald. Beyond that, the discussion is open and Mark had suggested that we could talk about Python 2.5 features a bit more.

I hope to see you there!
