Just dropping in a link to Glen Smith&#8217;s blog where there is a little discussion of [Commercial Swing Components?][1]. I&#8217;m definitely on the lookout for nifty Swing widgets these days. There was a suggestion to check out components made by Claude Duguay in various magazine articles, but these look like they may have the same [licensing issues that JavaWorld code does][2].
