c|net reports that [MusicNet][1] has gone live in the form of RealNetworks&#8217; RealOne Music. At a cost of $9.95 a month, you can download 100 songs. You can&#8217;t put those songs on a portable player, however. If you stop subscribing to the service, the songs go away. In my opinion, that is not the future of music&#8230; People like their collections of CDs and books, because they can go back to them whenever they want.

I don&#8217;t think you can throw that out just because it&#8217;s digital.
