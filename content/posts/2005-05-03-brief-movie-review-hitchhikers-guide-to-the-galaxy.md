I&#8217;ve read the Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide books at least a couple of times. Consequently, I didn&#8217;t like some of the script choices that they made when they moved the story to film. They excised a number of the funniest bits in exchange for some added visual bits that were not particularly entertaining or important to the story.

I _did_ like the visuals, and I think the movie may have played better to people who weren&#8217;t as familiar with the Guide. (This notion was somewhat supported by one of my friends who saw it with me and was less familiar with the books.)

For my part, though, I give it a 5 out of 10. It&#8217;s mildly entertaining, but a far cry from what it could have been.
