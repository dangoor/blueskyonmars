MIT has gotten a lot of press for their initiative to release course materials for all of their courses. The Berklee College of Music looks to be following in MIT&#8217;s footsteps with [Berklee Shares: free music lessons, mp3, quicktime and pdf files download][1]. This looks like a _great_ site and a great initiative. As a musician (albeit one with very little time on his hands), I would love to read and hear what some of the Berklee folks are teaching.

As with MIT&#8217;s courseware, just being able to follow the Berklee lessons is not the same as a person-to-person Berklee education. But, they&#8217;re opening up knowledge to a much broader audience.
