I&#8217;ve been very quiet about [Zesty News][1] the past few weeks. The reason for this is simple: I don&#8217;t like pitching vaporware. When I announced Zesty News at the end of April, I had a specific distinct bug list that I was going to tackle before release of the alpha, so I felt fine in announcing it. I don&#8217;t regret having done so, because I also wanted to put the name out there.

I&#8217;ve worked with some people who liked to emphasize that &#8220;plan is a verb&#8221;. You don&#8217;t make a plan and then stick to it rigidly, even as the world around you changes. In May, I made a couple of choices that have delayed the Zesty News software a bit. I&#8217;ll write more about that later.

I&#8217;m going to remain generally quiet about Zesty News at this point, until I ship the alpha.
