I hadn&#8217;t been paying attention to the TextMate blog, because the editor itself always notifies me when new releases come out and tells me what&#8217;s in them. I&#8217;ve been missing out, though! Here&#8217;s a [Tips and Tricks][1] posting that provides a couple of solutions for Python triple quoting and TextMate&#8217;s smart quotes (along with a few other tips, like a convenient diff against current saved file command). 

Even more recently, Allan wrote about [the Power of Snippets][2], which is a hugely powerful feature of TM. Pretty much anything you find yourself typing frequently can be easily turned into a snippet.

If you&#8217;re a Mac user (and particularly if you&#8217;re also a unixhead), TM is a great text editor.
