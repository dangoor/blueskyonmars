I&#8217;m working at home full-time now, so the ergonomics of my home office are important. I just came across [Cornell University&#8217;s ergonomics pages][1] which provide a whole bunch of info. For example, I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve considered a &#8220;negative-tilt&#8221; keyboard tray, but their diagram makes perfect sense. There&#8217;s a company that makes nice looking [hardwood ergonomic desks][2]. Notice how the first picture there has a negative tilt keyboard tray? Cool. Sadly, I&#8217;m not in a position to replace my desk, because my current desk holds my (rather lonely) music gear. However, maybe I can augment my current desk to be a bit better for me.

And this lousy chair should really go.
