Crysania is now 7 months old! She still on the small side, which is not surprising given that neither of her parents are particularly large. She&#8217;s up to over 14 pounds, 25.5&#8243; long (when does that switch over to &#8220;tall&#8221;?)

Yesterday, she started having some serious mommy separation anxiety. There have been times over the past couple of days where Crysania is only happy if Surekha is holding her. It&#8217;s not good enough for daddy to hold her in mommy&#8217;s presence. Quite a phase to witness.
