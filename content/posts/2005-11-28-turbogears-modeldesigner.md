Yesterday, the ever-resourceful Ronald Jaramillo introduced [ModelDesigner][1] for TurboGears, which he introduced with a [nice, quick screencast][2]. ModelDesigner lets you create TurboGears (SQLObject) model classes via some easy web forms.

ModelDesigner is part of the TurboGears Toolbox coming in 0.9. Ronald hasn&#8217;t checked it in to svn yet, but he promises to do so sometime soon.
