    I&#8217;m fixing up my home office a bit, and I was using a dirt cheap eMachines keyboard with my MacBook Pro. That keyboard had a PS/2 connector which I ran to a KVM switch (I <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> have two computers hooked up at one point). So, the first problem was that that keyboard was contributing the my overall cabling mess because of the KVM switch. The other problem was that my current desk, which I bought a few months back, has a much smaller keyboard tray and I&#8217;d have to peer under the edge of the desk to see the function keys. It&#8217;s also kind of annoying having the wrong meta key arrangement&#8230; I&#8217;ve been a Mac user for years now, and it would be nice to use a keyboard with Mac keys.

    So, I went out and bought an Apple keyboard. It obviously fits much better on my desk. I have no problem seeing all of the keys on this little guy. Additionally, I&#8217;ve got to say that I really like the feel. I wasn&#8217;t sure that I would, but the keys of this keyboard have a nice tactile response while still requiring very little key pressure or finger travel.

    Of course, the Apple keyboard is still a conventional layout keyboard, rather than an ergonomic one. I might be better off with an ergonomic keyboard layout, but for a standard layout keyboard I&#8217;m much happier with the feel of this one.
