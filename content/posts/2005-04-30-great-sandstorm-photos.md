This didn&#8217;t seem like the kind of thing that people would make up, but the photos are pretty incredible. Snopes reports that [these sandstorm photos][1] are likely genuine, and I&#8217;m sure it would be unnerving to be the one standing there taking those shots! Particularly if you&#8217;re from a non-sandstorm place like Michigan.
