Through the wonder of [JavaBlogs][1], I have come across [java.net &#8211; the Source for Java(tm) Technology Collaboration][2]. My initial thought upon seeing it is that it appears to be like SourceForge combined with Slashdot, but run by a big company rather than a few very interested individuals.

The projects part of Java.net is actually CollabNet software. Sun will probably get no end of grief because the Wiki is TWiki (which is written in Perl ðŸ™‚

One good thing I&#8217;ll say for Java.net is that they seem to have built up a bit of stuff to look at already. As an example, [JGoodies][3] is releasing some of their stuff as open source! Good news for anyone working on Java GUI apps.
