I haven&#8217;t been linking to the various parts of this story as it has unfolded. I finally decided to include a link to Andy Tanenbaum&#8217;s [Rebuttal to Ken Brown][1] on the subject of Ken Brown&#8217;s report that Linus Torvalds stole code for Linux from MINIX (Tanenbaum&#8217;s creation). This story is really funny, because this looks like one of these cases where someone (Ken Brown) was asked to do research where the conclusion was decided up front. Interestingly, Microsoft was caught at this a couple of years ago.

For the record, I think that Ken Brown must have stolen the inspiration and parts of his book from someone else. No single person could be so misguided ðŸ™‚
