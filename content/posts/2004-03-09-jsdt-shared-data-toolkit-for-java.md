Via [Ted Neward][1], here is [JSDT][2]:

> Enterprise developers can use the JSDT software to create network-centric applications, such as shared whiteboards or chat environments. It can also be used for remote presentations, shared simulations, and to easily distribute data for enhanced group workflow.

I&#8217;m working on a Swing application right now that will quite possibly benefit from this library being available. (It&#8217;s LGPL, by the way.)
