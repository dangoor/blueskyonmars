In an increasingly interesting story, Novell now says that it claims UNIX System V, and that [SCO is full of it][1] with regards to the letters that they have been sending Linux users. SCO has sued IBM and alleges that IBM has put some of SCO&#8217;s code into Linux. As the [CEO of Novell says][2], SCO really needs to show the world what proof they have of anything.
