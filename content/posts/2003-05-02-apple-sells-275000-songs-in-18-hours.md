Music industry pub [Billboard][1] says that Apple has sold 275,000 songs via its new music service. That&#8217;s a good start, but it will be interesting to see how much of that is just from curious people. I&#8217;m also curious if Billboard is going to start counting Apple&#8217;s sales in their charts.
