[Not Up to Code? Embellishing the Flag, Then the Web Site (washingtonpost.com)][1] talks about a number of laws that Bush has broken recently. This is partly a testament to how complex our legal system is, and partly a testament to how Bush is willing to bend the rules to get what he wants. There&#8217;s still that larger question hanging out there of how far the truth was extended in order to win support for the war against Iraq.
