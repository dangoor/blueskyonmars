The June meeting of the [Michigan Python Users Group][1] is coming up tomorrow. We&#8217;re back to the usual time and place, 7PM at Arbor Networks in downtown Ann Arbor.

The main topic on deck: the Python DB-API. Carsten Haese will be giving a newbie friendly talk on the topic, which is a nice contrast with last months rather more intensive PyPy/Stackless discussions (thanks Stephan, for that meeting!)
