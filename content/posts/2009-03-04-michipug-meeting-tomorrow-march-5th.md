The monthly [Michigan Python Users Group][1] (MichiPUG) meeting is coming up tomorrow! This month, we&#8217;re going to do something a little different: sprinting on a project to help out a new coworking space that is being set up in downtown Ann Arbor (see below for the full description from Bob Kuehne).

As usual, the meeting starts at 7PM at [SRT Solutions][2].

[proposal for 03/02/09 &#8211; Michigan Python Users Group | Google Groups][3]

> software side. it&#8217;s basically a bag of     
> scripts (python, natch), and some csv files for manager users,   
> logging, whatever. oh, and a door latch     
> that gets controlled by the above.
