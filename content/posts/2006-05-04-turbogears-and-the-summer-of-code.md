If you&#8217;re a student and want to hack on open source for fun and profit this summer, Google&#8217;s Summer of Code is a great program to get into. The time to pitch a project and run with it is _now_. TurboGears has mentors on board and our [SummerOfCode][1] wiki page gives some info about the kinds of projects we&#8217;re thinking of (feel free to pitch whatever great idea comes into your head!). We&#8217;ve already got someone considering go after SQLAlchemy schema migration, which is an exciting topic. Jonathan LaCour will likely be mentoring any SQLAlchemy-related projects. Simon Belak will mentor projects related to TurboGears itself. David Stanek also announced that he&#8217;s a mentor for Kid-related projects and has [some ideas up on the Kid site][2].
