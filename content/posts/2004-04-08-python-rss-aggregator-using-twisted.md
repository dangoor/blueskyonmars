[Python Cookbook : Rss aggregator with twisted][1] is a nice little piece of code that can handle truckloads of RSS feeds in a short period of time. One thing that always bothers me about things like this is that there is no license listed for this code, which essentially means it can&#8217;t be used. Maybe there&#8217;s a blanket license of all of the ASPN cookbook code, but that&#8217;s not clear to me.
  
**Update:** The [front page][2] of the Python Cookbook says that the code is &#8220;freely available for use and review&#8221;.
