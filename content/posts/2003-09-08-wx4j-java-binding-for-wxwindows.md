Not sure how I missed this, but some folks have put together [wx4j: A Java Binding for wxWindows][1]. There&#8217;s been plenty of talk about SWT and its use of native widgets. wxWindows is one of the best-known and longest-lived toolkits for using native widgets in a portable (Windows, Mac, Linux) way. Nifty stuff.
