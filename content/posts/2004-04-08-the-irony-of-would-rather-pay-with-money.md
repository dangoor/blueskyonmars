Paul Brown writes [about his troubles getting AspectJ editing to work in Eclipse][1]. His solution was to switch over to Emacs. Ironically, he uses this experience to relearn the lesson that &#8220;it is better to pay with money than with time&#8221; and saying that this is &#8220;also why people shouldn&#8217;t be shy about paying for or charging money for (working) software&#8221;.

I&#8217;m not so sure that RMS would be pleased about someone finding a solution in Emacs and then saying that people should not have a problem paying for working software üôÇ
