I would&#8217;ve just posted on his blog, but the anti-spam Turing test didn&#8217;t work for me. (I&#8217;m not a bot! I swear!) [Django will overtake Zope][1] shows a graph from the recently released Google Trends that would make it appear that Django (the web framework) was about to pass Zope in Google searches people run. Of course, Zope (and TurboGears for that matter) are both unique names in the search space.
  
You see those letters along the Django graph? Those are the letters that tell you that this comparison is complete BS.

In fact, Django (the web framework) wasn&#8217;t publicly released until mid-2005 and the Django graph had a modest uptick after its release.

In a month, Zope will indeed have less mindshare than Django the pool player and Django Reinhardt. But that comparison is almost as interesting as comparing Ruby on Rails to Britney Spears:
