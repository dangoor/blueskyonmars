[Apple][1] has given the full-blown Tiger treatment to their website. Mac OS 10.4 ships on April 29th, but can be [preordered now from Amazon][2], or the Apple Store. [TUAW][3] is running a poll to see [which Tiger feature people are most looking forward to][4]. Dashboard sounds great, but I think Spotlight is the one that really does it for me. Fast, full-text search baked right into the file system. Gotta love that!

**Update**: It&#8217;s worth noting that Amazon is offering a $35 rebate for preordering Tiger ($50 if you preorder the [Family Pack][5], which is 5 licenses).
