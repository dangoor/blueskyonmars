just read one of the scariest things I&#8217;ve ever read (this from a Reuters article regarding Gulf War II):

> The invasion marked the first use of a new U.S. strategic doctrine of pre-emptively attacking any country seen to pose a threat.

It&#8217;s scary to think of that as a new &#8220;strategic doctrine&#8221;. That makes it sound like something that will be applied regularly. If the administration really thinks of it in those terms, that is a frightening prospect indeed.
