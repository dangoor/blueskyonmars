[Artists blast record companies over lawsuits against downloaders][1]:

> &#8220;File sharing is a reality, and it would seem that the labels would do well to learn how to incorporate it into their business models somehow,&#8221; said genre-busting DJ Moby in a post on his Web site. &#8220;Record companies suing 12-year-old girls for file sharing is kind of like horse-and-buggy operators suing Henry Ford.&#8221;

A number of artists chime in here with thoughtful commentary. Moby, by the way, is not really a &#8220;DJ&#8221;&#8230; he&#8217;s a multi-instrumentalist and a producer.
