Nope, the book&#8217;s not out yet (though the writing is complete and we&#8217;re going through edits now). However, you can find good stuff about TurboGears in print in two places.

I&#8217;m tardy reporting on the first one. This is from Japan and I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;d call it a book or a magazine. It doesn&#8217;t have ads, but it&#8217;s also not as long as a typical book. Whatever you call it, it&#8217;s very interesting:

As you can see from the interesting character&#8217;s surfboard, this is a &#8220;Lightweight Languages&#8221; magazine. I wish I could read Japanese, because it looks amazingly interesting, with articles covering 5 different web frameworks that are in use today.

Luckily, I have no trouble reading the second recent appearance of TurboGears in print:

The October 2006 issue of Linux Magazine (at newsstands now) features an article by Mark Ramm which provides another good introduction to TurboGears.

If you&#8217;re just getting up to speed about TG or want to read more about it, check these out! Also, be sure to [say hi to Mark if you&#8217;re at the Ohio LinuxFest][1] this coming weekend. He&#8217;ll be at the [Spliced Networks][2] booth.
