Through the wonders of Slashdot discussions, I&#8217;ve come across [Red Chair Software&#8217;s Notmad Explorer][1], which aims to provide a better interface to the Creative Nomad series. I&#8217;ve got a Nomad Jukebox, and the software that Creative provides is _nasty_. It&#8217;s big and slow&#8230; I think I&#8217;ll give the trial version of this one a go!
