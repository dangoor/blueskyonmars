I&#8217;m sure that thousands of bloggers will be chiming in on the [Oscars][1]. 2001 was an interesting year in movies, and you could tell because so many Oscar categories had several viable candidates. I had been predicting a Best Picture win for Fellowship of the Ring (currently #3 on the [IMDB][2] 250), with a Best DIrector win for Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind).

Ron won, but the Best Picture followed the Best DIrector as it usually does. I haven&#8217;t seen Training Day to be able to comment on Denzel Washington&#8217;s Best Actor win. Russell Crowe was certainly Oscar-worthy in A Beautiful Mind. Halle Berry&#8217;s tearful Best Actress acceptance speech will probably be the most talked about acceptance speech. Finally, though I&#8217;m not a fan of his songs, one can&#8217;t help but feel a little happiness at Randy Newman winning an Oscar for Best Song after 16 nominations.
