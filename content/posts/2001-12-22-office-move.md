Yesterday was CareerSite&#8217;s office move, so I missed out on a day of blogging. The move was a lot of work (I&#8217;m still a little sore), even with 6 professional movers and 3 trucks (moving only two blocks!). The new building is very nice. I&#8217;ll probably be offline on Monday as well. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I&#8217;m back up by Wednesday though.
