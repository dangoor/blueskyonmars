If you&#8217;ve been wondering what a TurboGears book might look like, you need wonder no more:

More word on how and when you&#8217;ll be able to get ahold of the book is coming soon.

**Update**: So, I sometimes forget that not everyone has been working on this book for the past few months. The origin of this cover certainly warrants a little explanation.

Prentice Hall (Pearson) is a very large publisher with many brands and each brand has their own different collections of books. Each book series has a unifying cover theme, to let you know that a book is part of that series. It made sense for us to be in this series, because it&#8217;s open source focused, has a good series editor and happens to have another Python-related book coming out at around the same time. For cover comparison, here&#8217;s a book by the series editor Arnold Robbins:

The Python books in the series will have the snake on the cover (and spine) as well. Here&#8217;s a quote from Arnold&#8217;s book:

> &#8220;In the hands of a Jedi Knight, a light saber is both a powerful weapon and a thing of beauty. Its use demonstrates the power, knowledge, control of the Force, and arduous training of the Jedi who wields it.
> 
> &#8220;The elegance of the light saber mirrors the elegance of the original Unix API design. There, too, the studied, precise use of the APIs and the Software Tools and GNU design principles lead to today&#8217;s powerful, flexible, capable GNU/Linux system. This system demonstrates the knowledge and understanding of the programmers who wrote all its components.
> 
> &#8220;And, of course, light sabers are just way cool!&#8221;

So, now you know why there&#8217;s a light saber on our book ðŸ™‚
