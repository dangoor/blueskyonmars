More Segway commentary. This one is from [Dan Bricklin][1], who hasn&#8217;t had a chance to ride it. I think his points are very valid. No one knows at this point if the Segway will actually alter the way cities are planned, but it does seem likely that the Segway&#8217;s release will make people think about new ways to approach transportation.
