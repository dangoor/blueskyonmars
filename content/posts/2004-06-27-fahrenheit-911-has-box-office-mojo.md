I&#8217;ve never seen this site before: [Box Office Mojo][1] has all of the monetary stats you could want, organized in a very easy to access way. For people interested in this kind of data, it looks great.

Speaking of great, Fahrenheit 9/11 had a great opening on Friday. In _one day_ it became the 4th highest grossing documentary with more than $8M banked. If that kind of score holds up, it could end the weekend as the highest grossing documentary ever, beating out Michael Moore&#8217;s own _Bowling for Columbine_.
