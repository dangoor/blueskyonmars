Last night, I rediscovered [PythonCard][1]. I had read about it a few weeks back, and was not particularly interested. But, I just saw that there is a PythonCard-based program called [textRouter][2], which is designed to be a simple weblog posting program. textRouter itself looks interesting (particularly since Drupal supports the Blogger API).

PythonCard looks quite a bit more interesting now than it did before. I&#8217;m not completely sure if the &#8220;stack&#8221; metaphor of HyperCard is still a good one, but I will say that PythonCard looks like it makes it really easy to build GUI programs and keeps your visual layouts independent of your code.
