&#8220;This Week in Bespin&#8221; returns as &#8220;Project Bespin Summary&#8221;.&nbsp; It was clear to me some time back that weekly was not the right pace for delivering condensed Bespin news. But there is also interesting backstory and plenty that happens in between major releases, so we wouldn&#8217;t want major releases to be the only time for people to learn about what&#8217;s going on with the project.

The last major release, Bespin 0.4, got plenty of attention around the web and I posted an announcement message on the Bespin list after the release. So, here&#8217;s a quick round up of what&#8217;s been happening since the 0.4 release:

  * We released Bespin 0.4.1 on August 17th which corrected some issues spotted after the release of 0.4 (15 bugs closed). This release added a minor feature: you can set your username to be used when doing commits in a distributed version control system. 
  * On August 27th, we released Bespin 0.4.2 which thus far appears to have fixed some locking and stability issues we&#8217;ve had. Ben blogged [about the Bespin 0.4.2 release][1].
  * Ben posted an updated short-term [roadmap for Bespin][2] on his blog. You&#8217;ll note that release names have now changed from a cloud theme to some other theme that I will leave as an exercise for the reader.
  * Before you know it, Bespin 0.4.3 will be out. The ability to run familiar &#8220;svn&#8221; commands is already available on the Bespin hg tip for a few commands.
  * Git support for Bespin is very much in demand. [You can help!][3]
  * [We&#8217;re hiring!][4] Specifically, we&#8217;re looking for someone that will (at least initially) be responsible for the Canvas-based editor at the heart of Bespin. I have a [post up on my blog as well][5]. 

The next Project Bespin Summary is likely to come out soon after the 0.4.3 release.
