MIT opts for student rights when torn between a restriction on giving away student information and [a subpoena from the RIAA.][1]. Verizon says that they&#8217;ll only comply after legal options are exhausted, whereas Comcast will happily turn over information. Always interesting to see who works with their constituents.
