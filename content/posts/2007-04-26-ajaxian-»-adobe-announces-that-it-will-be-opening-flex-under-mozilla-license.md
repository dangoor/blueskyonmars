[Ajaxian Â» Adobe announces that it will be opening Flex under Mozilla License][1]. This is a big move on Adobe&#8217;s part, and it will be interesting to see how this shakes out against OpenLaszlo which previously could cite its open source nature as a benefit over Flex. Adobe still catches a lot of flak because the Flash player is closed source. Given their recent open source moves, I would be surprised if they aren&#8217;t seriously considering it. Adobe makes no money off of the basic Flex SDK, and the same goes for the Flash Player. If their business goal is to make their money off of the nicer development tools and environments, then open sourcing those things that they&#8217;ve been giving away may indeed make good sense.
