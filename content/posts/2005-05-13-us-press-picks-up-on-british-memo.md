A high-level British memo claiming that &#8220;intelligence and facts were being fixed&#8221; to support the Iraq war in mid-2002 has reached the mainstream US press. CNN has [the story][1]. Of course, as pointed out in CNN&#8217;s article, this had been claimed before. Do people still actually believe that the charges of an Iraqi threat were anything other than lies?
