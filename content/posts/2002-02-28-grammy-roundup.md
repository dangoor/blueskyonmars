Yes, Alicia Keys won 5 awards, _O Brother Where Art Thou_ won album of the year, but I think U2 was the big winner. For one, they won the coveted Record of the Year award. Bigger than that, I think, is that U2 was nominated multiple times for three different songs: Elevation, Walk On and Stuck In A Moment You Can&#8217;t Get Out Of. Add to this the fact that they won three Grammys last year for Beautiful Day, and you&#8217;ve got 4 Grammy-nominated songs on a single album.

Wow. All of the other major award nominated artists were nominated for single songs (Train&#8217;s _Drops of Jupiter_, Alicia Keys&#8217; _Fallen_, Nelly Furtado&#8217;s _I&#8217;m Like A Bird_).
