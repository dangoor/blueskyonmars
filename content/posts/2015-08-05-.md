Browser-based rich text (WYSIWYG) editing has existed for a very long time. Last week, I had a chance to review some of the &#8220;modern&#8221; rich text editors and this article is a bit of what I found.

For the [Khan Academy][1] [Healthy Hackathon][2], I worked with Sam Lau on experimenting with easier editing for [Perseus][3] articles. Currently, these articles are edited in a simple text area with Markdown formatting. We wanted to see what a rich text variation on this theme would be like.

## Limiting the richness

Editors like the venerable [CKEditor][4] offer many features and broad capabilities built over a long period of time.
