Skype had 2004 revenue of $7 million, and projects 2005 revenue of $60 million. Not earnings, but revenue&#8230; this makes the $2.6 billion that [eBay is paying to acquire Skype][1] quite remarkable. Skype does have powerful network effects going, though, and they will not prove easy to dethrone. Just like eBay. I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s where the attraction is, but the purchase amount just boggles the mind.

One thing I forgot to mention initially when I put this post up: eBay is paying $1.3 billion _in cash_. This isn&#8217;t the stock-for-stock hocus pocus that went on in the late &#8217;90s. The people who funded Skype get to walk away with real euros the day the transaction closes.

There must be something there, though. After all, Blazing Things&#8217; phone number comes from Skype In.
