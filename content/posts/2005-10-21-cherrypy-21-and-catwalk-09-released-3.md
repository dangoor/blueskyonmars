It doesn&#8217;t yet show up on the front page, but if you look at the [CherryPy downloads][1], you see that CherryPy 2.1 is out! Congrats to the CP team!

I&#8217;ve changed the svn version of TurboGears to use CherryPy 2.1 final, so TurboGears users will automatically get the update with 0.9.

Also of note, Ronald Jaramillo has released [CatWalk][2] 0.9 and has produced a spiffy [survey application tutorial][3]. Good work, Ronald!
