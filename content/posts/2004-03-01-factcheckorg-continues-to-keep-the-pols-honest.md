I&#8217;m subscribed to [FactCheck.org&#8217;s][1] email subscription list, so I receive their updates when they come up. Mozilla had caught them as spam for some reason (I wish the filter would tell me which words triggered this, but I guess the point of Bayesian filtering is to keep the details out of sight). I have just caught up with them. Lots of good stuff, and they certainly do seem balanced, finding fault with statements from Kerry and Bush both.

It&#8217;s a real shame that politics requires a site like FactCheck, but it&#8217;s great that the site is there!
