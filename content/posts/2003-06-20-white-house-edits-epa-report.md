The NYTimes says that a [Report by the E.P.A. Leaves Out Data on Climate Change][1], because of edits done by the White House before the release of the report.

> Agency officials said it was tentatively scheduled to be released early next week, before [agency administrator Christie] Whitman steps down on June 27, ending a troubled time in office that often put her at odds with President Bush.

If she is at all effective as a leader of the EPA, it&#8217;s not at all surprising that she would be at odds with Bush. President &#8220;let&#8217;s drill Alaska&#8221; Bush has not been a very environmentally conscious leader, and has certainly showed huge support for the oil industry.
