Mark beat me to posting about this: [TurboGears Documentation Sprint!][1]

That&#8217;s right, a documentation sprint! Saturday, April 29th at the Humantech office and on the #turbogears channel at freenode. Documentation for all of the cool new stuff is the biggest bug TurboGears has right now, so we want to get that fixed in a big way. There&#8217;s a lot that can be done, even for folks who don&#8217;t know enough about all of the new features to write about them.

Want to join in? Speak up on the [sprint mailing list][2].
