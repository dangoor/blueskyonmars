If you can be in Sandusky, Ohio next month, check out [CodeMash &#8211; January 18 & 19, 2007][1]. It&#8217;s a software development conference for people using just about any toolset to develop software. Early registration (ending on the 18th!) is $99, and the event is at an indoor waterpark. Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, PHP and more are all represented, and there&#8217;s a good lineup of speakers.
