[Zilverline][1] is a search engine that you can use for your files (or for your intranet, as I&#8217;m doing). It uses [Lucene][2] under the covers. I found it quite easy to set up. If you know Lucene query syntax, you can get very good search results. I&#8217;ve passed along an idea that should help get excellent results just entering straight keywords. We&#8217;ve got 91,000 documents indexed in there, and the searches are zippy even on a fairly modest box. Lucene is certainly very performant.

Kudos to Michael Franken for putting together Zilverline and making it available! (Soon to be open source, apparently. For now it&#8217;s just free.)
