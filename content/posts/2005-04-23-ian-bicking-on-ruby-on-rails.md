Ian Bicking has posted [more thoughts on Ruby on Rails][1]. For those of you not familiar with Ian, he&#8217;s had his hands in [object-relational mapping][2], [web][3] [frameworks][4] and even [template tools][5].

Ian&#8217;s perspective in this latest article is from short experimentation with Rails, but I agree with the things that he has said that he likes and dislikes. Ian has [described Paste][6] in terms that make it sound like a piece of middleware for web framework developers to use in sharing code. While that&#8217;s all fine and dandy, I do hope that we&#8217;ll start to see some fully-fleshed out packages that provide a good quick start for apps.

If nothing else, Rails has brought to light the fact that starting each new project with a completely blank slate is a real drag.
