American Idol winner Ruben Studdard has signed a record deal and so has [runner-up Clay Aiken.][1] June 3rd (!), J Records will be releasing Ruben&#8217;s &#8220;Flying Without Wings&#8221; as a single. Personally, I didn&#8217;t think too much of that song. Clay&#8217;s &#8220;This Is The Night&#8221; comes out on June 10th, which I think coincides with Justin&#8217;s album release. So, we&#8217;ve got at least 3 new AI releases in the next couple of weeks, plus the movie. It will be interesting to see how long they can keep up this sort of pace.
