The [list of talks for PyCon 2006][1] is up. There are lots of good topics planned, including two TurboGears sessions. Mark Ramm, who I&#8217;m helping out on a forthcoming TurboGears book, will be doing a tutorial session on TurboGears. I&#8217;ll be doing a talk on &#8220;effective AJAX&#8221;, which is all about making a usable AJAXified web app (samples, of course, will be in TurboGears).

Though I&#8217;ve used Python for many years, this will be my first PyCon, so I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.
