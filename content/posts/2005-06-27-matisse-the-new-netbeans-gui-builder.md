[Matisse &#8211; the new NetBeans GUI Builder][1] looks quite nice from the demo screencast. Though it&#8217;s been several months since I was looking at the Eclipse GUI building tools, this is far ahead of those tools in ease-of-use. Very nice work!

I did see one comment that compared this with Apple&#8217;s Interface Builder. Something I didn&#8217;t see in Matisse (maybe it&#8217;s there, but it wasn&#8217;t in the screencast), is the data binding aspect of IB. Being able to draw a nice looking, internationalizable, resizable, cross-platform GUI is quite a trick&#8230; but, being able to also wire it up to your objects without a whole bunch of controller code is the bit of beauty you get from IB.

Perhaps the data binding of [JDNC][2] will get hooked up with a future version of the Netbeans GUI builder.
