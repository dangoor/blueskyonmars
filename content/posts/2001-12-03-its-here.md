The big news today is that Dean Kamen has announced the long-discussed IT, aka Ginger. The product is called [Segway][1], and it is a scooter-like device. Time has a [five page article][2] about it. What makes the Segway interesting is that you ride it standing up and it uses gyros and software-controlled motors to maintain balance and figure out where you want to go.

Plus, with two independently controlled wheels, it has a turning radius of zero. The 60lb consumer model is expected to be available in a year for $3,000.
