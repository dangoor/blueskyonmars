This blog went an entire week without entries, which is quite unusual. The week before that was quite quiet, too. I don&#8217;t think Blue Sky On Mars has ever had that lengthy a quiet period.

It started with a trip to Niagara Falls, for a JSTOR-wide company retreat. That was a packed couple of days, but it was a good chance to meet people from our New York office. Things were busy after getting back, because we&#8217;re full-steam-ahead on our project at work, and I&#8217;m pair programming all day these days.

The weekend after Niagara Falls, I wound up with a nasty little cold, that I&#8217;m only now just about done with.

Then, last Friday, I finally had LASIK performed on my heretofore unaltered eyes. I&#8217;ve had a pretty easy recovery thus far, my vision is pretty good (but still stabilizing). I&#8217;d certainly recommend it for anyone who is not afraid of having their eyes tampered with and whose vision will likely be restored to 20/20. After years of wearing glasses or contacts, it is a huge change to be able to see so well without any additional apparatus. For me, the procedure was fully painless.

One word of advice: if they have a monitor in the pre-op area that is showing a LASIK procedure that is currently underway, don&#8217;t look at it. I was doing fine before the operation until I saw a 20&#8243; (diagonal) eye being kind of abused. I still did fine after that, but the sight made me a little more tense. I found it much easier to go through in the first person than to view in the third.

My LASIK was performed by Dr. Sensoli at TLC in Ann Arbor. He&#8217;s performed thousands of these procedures and did great for me.
