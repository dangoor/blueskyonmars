A federal judge in Denver has halted the [implementation
  
of the national do-not-call list][1] on free speech grounds. I particularly enjoyed this quote from the article:

> &#8220;Our Constitution allows consumers to choose not to receive commercial telemarketing calls,&#8221; [FTC Chairman Timothy] Muris said in a statement.

That&#8217;s crazy talk. Which Constitution is he reading? The one that was written pre-1800 certainly didn&#8217;t get into &#8220;telemarketing calls&#8221;, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily obvious that Congress can block phone calls. Ultimately, I do think that telemarketing calls should not be protected speech because they are intrusive, person-to-person communications. It&#8217;s the same kind of thing as having a &#8220;No Solicitation&#8221; sign. People have a right to make their statements and be heard, but they do not have a right to invade my private space when they do it.
