Yesterday, a whole bunch of people showed up for a meeting to [discuss TurboGears 0.9][1]. Not only did they show up, they stuck around for 3 hours. We had a lot to discuss and there are quite a few people contributing code. The activity level is great and I can&#8217;t wait to have a fully-baked 0.9 out the door.
