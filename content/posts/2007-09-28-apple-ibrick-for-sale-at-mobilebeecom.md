For just $510 with a T-Mobile contract, you can [&#8220;Buy a Apple iPhone&#8221;][1]. Of course, once you get it and set it up, you&#8217;re likely to update to the latest iPhone software. At which point, <a href='http://iphone.macworld.com/2007/09/bricking\_my\_ipod_1.php">you&#8217;ll be the proud owner of an iBrick</a>. I can&#8217;t believe that anyone would actually try to _sell_ an iPhone with T-Mobile service. Sure, I can understand someone trying to use it that way, but selling such a blatantly unsupported configuration is just asking for unhappy customers.
