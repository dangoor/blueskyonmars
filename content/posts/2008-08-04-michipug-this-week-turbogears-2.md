[TurboGears 2][1] is currently out in alpha test releases and is rapidly approaching maturity (I know a few people using it in production already). This week at MichiPUG, Mark Ramm will be showing off the good stuff in TG2.

The [Michigan Python Users Group][2] meeting will be Thursday, August 7th at 7PM.

See you there!
