Woah&#8230; you can write [Quicksilver][1] plugins [in Python][2]. I guess it makes sense, given how all-encompassing PyObjC is, but I&#8217;ll definitely have to start thinking of applications for this. I&#8217;ve been hooked on Quicksilver for a while now (and I&#8217;m still waiting for someone to make it for Windows!)
