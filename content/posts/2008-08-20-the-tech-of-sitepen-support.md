I&#8217;ve just posted an article with some details on how SitePen&#8217;s Support system is built. We use Python on the server and Dojo-driven JavaScript on the browser to create a responsive system. The model we use is similar to what I described in my PyCon 2008 talk where the client is driving the interaction rather than the server.

    SitePenâ€™s Support service is built using a variety of interesting techniques and technologies. Read on to see how we built a system that treats the web browser as a real client tier and bridges the worlds of JavaScript, Python and PHP seamlessly to provide a great experience for our customers.
