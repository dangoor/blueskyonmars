One question that comes up more and more (particularly as media companies are consolidating and joining with tech companies): where do you draw the line between news and advertising? C|Net&#8217;s got an article about [TimeCanada breaking Apple&#8217;s embargo on news of the new iMac][1]. The part of the article that I find more interesting than the embargo breaking itself is where they talk about the Time story about the new iMac. When a mainstream publication goes all gushy over a new piece of gear that&#8217;s not **that** exciting, something is amiss.
