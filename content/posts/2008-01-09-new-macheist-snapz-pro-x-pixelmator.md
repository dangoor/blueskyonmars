MacHeist is back with a new [MacHeist Bundle][1]. For people not familiar with MacHeist (or similar), they take a bunch of indie Mac developer apps and put &#8217;em together for cheap ($49). I&#8217;ve been eyeing 1password for its iPhone support, which will undoubtedly be better when the iPhone SDK comes out. AppZapper sounds useful. The others, I&#8217;m less sure about&#8230; until you get to the ones that need unlocking.

Snapz Pro X, which I don&#8217;t need because I already own and use it for screencasting, is a great tool. Pixelmator looks quite slick, and I&#8217;ll definitely buy the bundle if it gets unlocked.
