An excellent first part of an article at Linuxworld about [giving desktop computer users at the office what they need at a low cost][1]. I mean a _really_ low cost. There are some real merits to what&#8217;s presented in this article, I&#8217;m just not sure how many people are ready to move that far away from Windows.
