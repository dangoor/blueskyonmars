I&#8217;m completely in favor of copyright holders (even the big conglomerate sorts) making money from their labors. However, I&#8217;m not in favor of copyright holders [decimating the public domain][1] (which is effectively a Constitution-granted right) and [restricting what I can do for my own personal use with the items I buy][2] (which is just stupid and bad business).

Thanks to Boing Boing (and the [EFF&#8217;s][3] Cory Doctorow) for continuing to highlight the arguments against infinite copyright and DRM.
