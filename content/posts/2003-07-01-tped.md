Well, it&#8217;s happened&#8230; for the first time in my adult life someone has toilet papered some of our trees. And the little prankster also wrote, in shaving cream, &#8220;I own you&#8221; on our driveway. Hee hee. They TPed some of the neighbors&#8217; trees as well. TPing trees is one of those pranks that will probably never go out of style. (South Park even did an episode where the boys TPed someone&#8217;s house. The whole family came out and said &#8220;Oh my God! Who would do such a thing?&#8221; and started sobbing. Hilarity ensues ðŸ™‚
