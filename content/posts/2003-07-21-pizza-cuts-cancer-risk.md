This is [my kind of study:][1]

> A study of 8,000 Italians found that regular pizza-eaters were 59 percent less likely to contract cancer of the esophagus, while the risk of developing cancer of the colon fell by 26 percent.

Of course, maybe this only impacts Italians (and maybe the pizza they serve in Italy is different). But, still, it&#8217;s encouraging!
