I agree with _most_ of what Greenspun says about [how music CDs are dead][1], and really should have died years ago. I don&#8217;t wholly agree with this part:

> Most people don&#8217;t want to make a lot of 25 cent or 99 cent purchase decisions every day. They&#8217;d rather pay a fixed known subscription and have the freedom to &#8220;flip channels&#8221; to their heart&#8217;s content.

I think that people actually want both and I think there&#8217;s quite a bit of history on my side in that argument. People have been buying singles and albums for a long time. Why? Because they want to be able to listen to whichever songs they feel like whenever they want (and wherever they want!) Sure, XM has a lot of channels&#8230; but if I feel like listening to Depeche Mode, they don&#8217;t have a &#8220;Depeche Mode&#8221; channel, whereas my iPod does.
  
Buying singles for under $1 is something that people can get their minds around, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just the Macintosh types who have sucked up 10 million ITMS tracks.
