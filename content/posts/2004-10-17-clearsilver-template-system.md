[Neotonic ClearSilver][1] is an open source template system that is written in C, but with bindings for Java, Perl and Python. That&#8217;s right, a language-neutral template system, designed to be easier to grok and user for most things than XSLT. Though it&#8217;s new in my little universe, it&#8217;s not a new package. It is in use at Bloglines, Google Groups 2, and in other conspicuous places. Seems pretty high on the spiff-o-meter.
