Can a day go by without a recording industry story? Perhaps, but not today&#8230;

Moby&#8217;s great. Here&#8217;s a multiplatinum recording artist saying that he disagrees with the RIAA tactics and is even [tempted to see if they&#8217;d sue him][1] for sharing his _own_ music! That would make a great headline.

Unfortunately, unless Moby owns his recordings, they probably could sue him. That would be yet another fiasco for the RIAA, though, since they&#8217;ve been contending that they&#8217;re doing these suits for the artists.
