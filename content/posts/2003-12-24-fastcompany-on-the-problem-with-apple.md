An excellent, and I think accurate, article from FastCompany: [If He&#8217;s So Smart&#8230;Steve Jobs, Apple, and the Limits of Innovation][1].

> There&#8217;s one last essential element to successful innovation that has often been missing at Apple: follow-through.

This is why next year is going to be very interesting. Apple will either show some serious follow-through with their music strategy, or they will become an also-ran. There have been so many products competing with iTunes and iPod over the past few weeks that a wrong turn can seriously knock Apple down.

The rumored low-cost iPods may certainly help, and I think it also helps that Apple has the most consistent and usable music store as of today. They&#8217;ve got the lead, no question.
