This week, Amnesty International&#8217;s [irrepressible.info][1] campaign website (developed by the folks at [Soda][2]) was simultaneously [Slashdotted][3] and [Observed][4] (the Observer being a popular UK paper) and lived to tell the tale. The irrepressible.info campaign is all about human rights and freedom on the net.
  
Also, some news that I forgot to blog a couple weeks ago. [Diggdot.us][5] recently appeared in MacWorld [as one of the go-to sites for geeks][6].

It&#8217;s great to see these successful sites with TurboGears under the hood.
