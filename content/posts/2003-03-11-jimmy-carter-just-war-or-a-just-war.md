Thank goodness for freedom of speech. In some nations, even a former leader would be unable to [speak out against current foreign policy][1]. Jimmy Carter makes some excellent arguments, and I hope that polls continue to show dwindling support for unilateral US action in Iraq. I don&#8217;t believe that the Bush administration&#8217;s foreign policy is representative of the majority view in America, and certainly is not representative of the beliefs of the rest of the world.

Between his foreign and economic policies, Bush is making things easier for the 2004 Democratic candidate.
