Maybe the headline is a little superlative&#8230; but, wow. [Google Maps][1] is really, really cool. Even better, it&#8217;s cool in a useful way. They made it easy to zero in on the area you want (even using the keyboard if you wish), and then, when you search, it searches in that area! The visuals are great.
