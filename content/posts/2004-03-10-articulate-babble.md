Sunday was a fairly talkative day for Crysania, and I guess over the course of the day she figured some stuff out because on Monday she suddenly kicked in to what I&#8217;d call &#8220;articulate babble&#8221;. She&#8217;s now making more sounds than before and using different inflections as she&#8217;s talking. We can carry on whole conversations now! I just hope I haven&#8217;t already promised her a car for her 16th birthday without realizing it!
