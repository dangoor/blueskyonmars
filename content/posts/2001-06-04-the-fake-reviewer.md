From MSNBC: [The Reviewer Who Wasn&#8217;t There][1]: _&#8220;The studio plastered Manning&#8217;s raves over at least four different movie advertisements, including &#8216;Hollow Man&#8217; and &#8216;Vertical Limit.&#8217; But Manning&#8217;s own life story should be called &#8216;Charade,&#8217; because he doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;_ Amazing. The article makes the point that studios regularly manage to get the quotes they want.

That no one would question the authenticity of this reviewer shows how they&#8217;re willing to take whatever quotes they can get. It makes you appreciate the [Rotten Tomatoes][2] Cream of the Crop section.
