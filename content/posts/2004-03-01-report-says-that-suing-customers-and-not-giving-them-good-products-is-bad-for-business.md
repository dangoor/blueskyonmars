Or, at least, that&#8217;s more or less what [the Committee for Economic Development said in their report][1]. This is a Washington-based policy group that has had significant influence in the past and is generally pro-business. They say that there is a fundamental difference between physical product and bits of data and that this difference should be recognized.

Unfortunately, the report endorses the private use of DRM (private meaning not mandated by the government). This is unfortunate because DRM does little more than hinder regular customers.
