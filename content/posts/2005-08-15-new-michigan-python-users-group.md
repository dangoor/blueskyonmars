It didn&#8217;t take long to hear back from eight people in southeast lower Michigan (with a disproportionate percentage in Ann Arbor), so I have gone ahead and started the [Michigan Python Users Group][1] (michipug) mailing list.

People have different agendas for their user groups. Jim Holmes [appeared to be seeking World Domination][2] with his .NET user group in Dayton, Ohio. I&#8217;m going to toss out an opening volley in what I&#8217;d like to see in a user group:

  * Semi-regular, face-to-face, semi-structured meetings to meet up with smart people and exchange useful and practical info about software development in Python.
  * Exchange of useful local information on the mailing list (relevant job postings, events, etc).
  * Occasional sprints, for people interested in writing some code together
  * An organized group that can harrass Python dignitaries that happen to come to Michigan into sharing a slice of their knowledge. (Consider yourself warned, visting dignitaries! ðŸ™‚

This all sounds fairly similar to [ChiPy][3], which doesn&#8217;t seem to be a bad thing, because those guys seem to be enjoying themselves.

So, if you&#8217;re somewhere in Michigan, use or want to use Python, and have email: sign up now for [michipug][1].
