News.com has an editorial with [some interesting options for fixing the music business][1]. This model involves using an ASCAP-like organization to monitor music usage and distribute revenues that come from unusual sources (like car companies and other sponsors). The author estimates that 50 million people spend an average of $250 a year on music, and that this figure seems manageable for other marketing methods. He mentions that Apple or Sony are possible companies to lead the charge, and he might be right. If someone can propose a model that will give artists similar or better pay to what they have today, but with increased exposure and other benefits, they would probably jump at it.
