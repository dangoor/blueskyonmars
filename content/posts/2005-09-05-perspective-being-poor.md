John Scalzi provides an excellent perspective piece on [Whatever: Being Poor][1]. Something to consider, though: this is being poor _in America_. If you&#8217;re talking about poor in India, China, Africa or almost anywhere else in the third world, you can downgrade just about every one of these even further. Seriously, if you think &#8220;Being Poor&#8221; sounds depressing as written (and it likely does, for those of us reading and writing blogs), just transplant your brain to Africa as you read.

Being poor is not having a TV. Or a phone. Or electricity.

Being poor is walking miles to the market or to school, because there is no car.

Being poor is rocks and sticks for toys.

Being poor is thinking $1 an hour is a really good deal.

I&#8217;m not writing this to belittle the poor in the US. It is rough to be poor anywhere, and those of us above the poverty line are blessed. I just wanted to add to John&#8217;s excellent post a bit about just how good we have it here in the developed world.
