Jim Hugunin who, if memory serves, was one of the originators of Jython has open sourced [IronPython &#8211; A fast Python implementation for .NET and Mono][1]. This comes on the heels of his announcement that he is going to work for Microsoft in their CLR group. Though I&#8217;m a Java programmer most of the time these days, I&#8217;m still quite fond of Python. IronPython sounds like a great way to develop desktop apps, if that&#8217;s your thing. (And if you don&#8217;t mind forcing your users to get either .NET or Mono)
