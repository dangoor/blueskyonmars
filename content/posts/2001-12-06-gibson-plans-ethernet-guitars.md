This [slashdot posting][1] has a link and discussion about Gibson&#8217;s new MAGIC protocol. Gibson plans to license it royalty-free. Basically, this runs audio across Ethernet, and defines some higher level protocols for identifying devices, etc. I have a lot of cables in my studio, and if that could be replaced by a couple of Ethernet buses, that would be very cool.

Could eliminate the need for audio patchbays.
