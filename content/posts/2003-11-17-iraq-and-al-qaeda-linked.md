According to the Weekly Standard ([Case Closed][1]):

> OSAMA BIN LADEN and Saddam Hussein had an operational relationship [&#8230;] according to a top secret U.S. government memorandum obtained by THE WEEKLY STANDARD.

I&#8217;ve been critical of the current administration&#8217;s handling of Iraq from the get-go. If all of this evidence had been swirling around, it&#8217;s surprising that this &#8220;top secret&#8221; memo was written on October 27th. The administration made the claim much earlier. This sounds more like scraping up whatever can be found to support what the administration has already done.

That said, this could at least improve Bush&#8217;s credibility somewhat by validating some claims made. Blaming Iraq for 9/11 is still outrageous, though.
