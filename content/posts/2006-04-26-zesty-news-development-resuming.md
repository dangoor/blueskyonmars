I am very happy to report that development of Zesty News is now restarting. After quite a bit of discussion with different people, followed by a bit of contract hammering, I&#8217;ve just signed a contract with [Appropriate Solutions, Inc.][1] (ASI) to continue the development of Zesty News. I will continue wearing the product manager, marketing and sales hats. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed talking with Ray Cote of ASI these past couple of months, and think they&#8217;ll be a great partner on this.

I&#8217;m also really excited to have the development pick back up. Even after a few months of stagnation, Zesty News still has unique features and aspects to it, and we&#8217;re going to push even further on those in the coming months as we see the product through to completion.
