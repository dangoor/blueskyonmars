CNN and others are reporting on the [resignation of Napster leadership][1]. This includes the CEO, Konrad Hilbers, and Shawn Fanning, the original author of the software and founder of the company. I do hope that Fanning and Napster are remembered for the revolution they&#8217;ve caused, and I hope that Fanning gets another shot at driving change in the entertainment business.
