Ned Batchelder [clued me][1] (and his hordes of other readers) in to [NiceXSL][2]. I&#8217;ve always found XSL to be annoying, not because it&#8217;s declarative but because it has a nasty syntax. NiceXSL has a far more natural (for a programmer) syntax that is translated directly into XSL. It looks like the current implemention is in Java.
