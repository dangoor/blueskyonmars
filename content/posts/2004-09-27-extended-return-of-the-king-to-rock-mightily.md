New Line has announced details of the <a title="Yahoo! News - All Hail Extended "King"" href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=794&e=3&u=/eo/20040927/en\_movies\_eo/15020">extended edition of Return of the King</a>. It clocks in at over 4 hours in length and has bunches of new scenes (including the scouring of the Shire), new effects and new music. Sounds dazzling, but we&#8217;ve gotta wait until December 14th to pick it up. ROTK has passed $1 billion in worldwide box office, only the second movie to do so.
