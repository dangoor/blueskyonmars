What a great idea! [Win2VNC][1] gives you the standard VNC functionality of controlling another machine. The way it does it is really spiffy, though&#8230; you go to the edge of your monitor and all of a sudden, you&#8217;re looking at the other machine&#8217;s screen! Just like dual monitors, only with multiple computers!
