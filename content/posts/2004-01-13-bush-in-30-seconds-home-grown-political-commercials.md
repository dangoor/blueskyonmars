For anyone who doubted that this election is any different from ones previous, check out [Bush in 30 Seconds][1], a contest sponsored by [MoveOn][2]. A thousand commercials were submitted, and the judges picked 4 to highlight. A contest like this would have been inconceivable in the days prior to cheap digital video and Internet distribution.

The contest winner, which I think is a great commercial that uses strong imagery to talk about the problem with the budget deficit, will be aired on TV.
