Being sick when you&#8217;ve got your own business and you&#8217;re really looking forward to shipping is a drag. As a general rule, I don&#8217;t code when I&#8217;m sick&#8230; so, though I have code that I really, really want to write today, I&#8217;m going to wait &#8217;til tomorrow.

Since English does not have to be as presize ðŸ™‚ as code, I&#8217;m going to catch up on some blogging today.
