[Ximian&#8217;s Volunteer &#8216;Army&#8217; Fights Microsoft on Open Source Code][1]: _During the half-hour conference, which took place earlier this year, he [de Icaza] ran though this math with Fox: At a retail price of $209 for Windows and $440 for Office, it could cost the country as much as $3.25 billion just for license fees. &#8220;Our country needs that money for many other things,&#8221; de Icaza said he told Fox. He said Fox seemed to be surprised by the cost analysis, but he made no promises._ I&#8217;d imagine Microsoft would give a discount for 58 million licenses, but you can bet those licenses would probably still cost Mexico $1 billion. De Icaza&#8217;s target of relatively poor, developing nations as a new stronghold for Open Source is a good plan. The more people that use it and improve it, the better it gets&#8230; and then the wealthier nations and businesses won&#8217;t be able to afford to ignore it.

It&#8217;s also interesting to note that Microsoft may be losing a big ally in Compaq. HP, between HP/UX and Linux initiatives, has more Unix in its history and may not prove to be such a solid ally for Microsoft.
