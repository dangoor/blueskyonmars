Two years ago, I wrote about how [Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&#8217;s $90 million haul][1] was bigger than that of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest movie of the week. With reports of [Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince][2] selling through more than 10 million copies \*today\*, this book is debuting bigger than any movie has ever debuted. If Amazon&#8217;s $17 price is at all representative, that means that Half-Blood Prince will have a $170 million day.

Oh, and if the spolier Stallman posted a couple days ago turns out to be accurate, this is going to be a helluva story.
