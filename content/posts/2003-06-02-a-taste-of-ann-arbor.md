It&#8217;s been nearly 13 years since I moved to Ann Arbor, and yesterday was the first time that I had gone to the &#8220;Taste of Ann Arbor&#8221;, an annual event in which local restaurants set up booths along Main St. making it easy to sample some of their items. Samples aren&#8217;t free though: you buy a bunch of 50 cent tickets (that is, tickets that cost fifty centers, not tickets to see 50 Cent), and pay anywhere between 2 and 12 tickets for things. The weather was beautiful, there was live music and some carnival attractions (like the rubber chicken trebuchet). As is typical for something involving food in Ann Arbor, there were heaving throngs of people. The lines were pretty long, so if we go next year we&#8217;ll probably want to plan to spend 90 minutes at least&#8230; which may be difficult with an 11 month old, but we&#8217;ll see.
