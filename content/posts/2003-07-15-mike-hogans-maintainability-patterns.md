Two good articles by Mike Hogan: [Maintainability Pattern: Write less code][1] and [Maintainability Pattern: Manage Dependencies][2].

I heard a good analogy from some folks who do XP training near here. In a software shop, code is your inventory and it&#8217;s something to be managed well. Having vast numbers of lines of code is not necessarily something to be proud of&#8230; you want to have just the right number of lines.
