Eric Sink has written about [the failure of open source][1]. He says that as a concept, you can&#8217;t throw it out, because there is a lot of good quality open source. But, as a business model, it hasn&#8217;t worked. He calls open source the lowest margin of software businesses, and low margin businesses are indeed quite difficult.

I agree with what he says about office suites and operating systems eventually becoming commodities. Microsoft proves that they&#8217;re not commodities yet.
