Craig Burton comments on [VA Linux&#8217;s move to sell software][1]. I think he&#8217;s on the mark here. (As if you hadn&#8217;t guessed from reading [The Software Commons][2]). I&#8217;ve never been a believer in [Free Software][3]. I&#8217;ve generally thought of the [Open Source folks][4] as being a bit more pragmatic.

But, my view has always been that free, open source is appropriate for some things. Non-free software makes sense for others. (I&#8217;m not completely sure about &#8220;closed source&#8221;. There are enough software products that die out that it would be nice to have the source for things you use.)
