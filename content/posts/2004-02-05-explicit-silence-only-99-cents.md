[Crank it! iTunes sells sounds of silence&#8211;for real][1]

> Even more humorously, three of the tracks&#8211;all titled &#8220;Silent&#8221; and all by hip-hop group Slum Village&#8211;are labeled as explicit, even though there is only silence. For those who worry that the lack of sound will be too racy, iTunes offers &#8220;clean versions&#8221; as well.
