TurboGears has been accepted as a [Google Summer of Code organization][1]. Chris Arndt has put together a page at docs.turbogears.org to pull together all of the [TG Summer of Code information][2]. Congrats to Chris and the others for pulling together this year&#8217;s Summer of Code effort for TG!

Next week is signup time for students (March 24-31), so if you&#8217;re interested in getting paid to work on TurboGears this summer, check out the [TG SoC info page][2].
