Since I started using the convenient L10 Hit Counter in June, I&#8217;ve been able to very easily see what people are reading here whenever I want. Mysteriously, the #3 URL here, just behind the BSOM front page, since mid-June is my posting about [the Flying Spaghetti Monster][1]. Apparently, the Pastafarians are a larger more dedicated lot than I originally expected. The original [FSM site][2] has grown quite a bit. 10 million hits (now up to 750k per day), and startling bits of work like [Touched By His Noodly Appendage][3].

Bobby Henderson has finally provided reasons to convert to Flying Spaghetti Monsterism:

  * Flimsy moral standards.
  * Every friday is a relgious holiday. If your work/school objects to that, demand your religious beliefs are respected and threaten to call the ACLU.
  * Our heaven is WAY better. We&#8217;ve got a Stripper Factory AND a Beer Volcano.

The big news comes from Boing Boing (from whence all big news comes): there&#8217;s [$750,000 up for grabs][4] for anyone that can prove that Jesus is not the son of the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Just as the original FSM open letter was a parody of the insanity of suppressing evolution science, this purse is a parody of [an offer for $250,000 for proof that evolution occurs][5] (with a big * that broadens the notion of evolution to include the proverbial kitchen sink).

Ahhh&#8230; the Net has been touched by his noodly appendage indeed.
