One of my most enduringly popular blog entries is the one in which I [call out for a Mac version of Camtasia][1], TechSmith&#8217;s exceedingly cool screencasting tool. If you search Google for &#8220;camtasia mac&#8221;, that posting is the top link. Troy Stein, Camtasia&#8217;s product manager, has been active in the conversation in the comments on that entry, and today clued me in to [Jing Project: Visual conversation starts here. Mac or Windows.][2]

Jing is an integrated screen capture and sharing tool and marks the first major foray in the Mac software for TechSmith that I&#8217;m aware of (they do have a Mac version of their codec, but that&#8217;s not the same as an actual app!). You&#8217;re limited to making 5 minute Flash movies (likely using TechSmith&#8217;s awesome lossless codec), but Jing is _free_ and many screencasts are 5 minutes or less anyhow.

Of course, I still want to see Camtasia for the Mac, because of its great editing tools. But, it&#8217;s great to see TechSmith heading into the Mac market!
