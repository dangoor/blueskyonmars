This blog has always been for my personal use. I&#8217;ve been free to write what I please here and link to whatever I think is interesting and that I want to remember.

I&#8217;ve decided to try out Google&#8217;s AdSense ads here because:

1. I don&#8217;t feel that the ads will change my freedom to write what I wish here. Nothing I&#8217;ve written over the past 4 years violates the Terms of Service, so I have no reason to expect I&#8217;ll start now.
  
2. AdSense ads can be unobtrusive. I&#8217;ve chosen the text-only ads at this point, and I have no plans to put ads in my RSS feeds. An ad-per-entry in an RSS feed would be nasty, and I&#8217;d have to be really sure that they&#8217;re not getting in the way of my main content.
  
3. AdSense \*can\* add value. I&#8217;m going to watch what kind of ads show up, but Google has a terrific advertising model.
  
4. This site gets enough traffic that some of my hosting costs will be offset by the ads.

To expand on #3 above, I think that Google has grown to $1 billion a year in \*profit\* because they went after an advertising model in which everyone wins. Overture (formerly Goto, and now part of Yahoo!) pioneered the auction-style pay-per-click model, but Google added a really important element: performance. In order to keep an ad in rotation on Google, the companies have to get a certain percentage of clickthroughs. In other words, the ad has to be relevant and interesting to users.

I&#8217;ve seen many people with the same kind of attitude about this that I have: it&#8217;s an experiment. If I like what the ads are showing and don&#8217;t feel in any way constrained or influenced by them, they&#8217;ll stay. Most of the blogs that I&#8217;ve seen that have added the ads have stuck with them, so I guess they&#8217;ve been working well.

One thing I can assure you that I&#8217;m not about to start doing is writing about [asbestos][1] or some other topic in which I have no interest whatsoever. That just seems like a waste.
