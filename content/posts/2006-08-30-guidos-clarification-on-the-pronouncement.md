[Django: Python on a Plane][1]
  
&#8220;I don&#8217;t do a lot of Web programming, and the Web programming that I do isn&#8217;t very complex, so I&#8217;m not sure that my vote should count very strongly,&#8221; [Guido] added. &#8220;But people keep asking me to pick one, and I like Django because I like the way its authors run their project: They really &#8216;get&#8217; open-source development.&#8221;
