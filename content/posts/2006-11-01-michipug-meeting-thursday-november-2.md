The November meeting of [MichiPUG][1] will be tomorrow, Thursday, November 2nd at 7PM at the Arbor Networks office. Last month&#8217;s meeting had a filled schedule with talks on wxPython and Twill. This month, we&#8217;ve got our most open schedule we&#8217;ve had for a few months. The one topic we&#8217;ve decided on is that we&#8217;re going to talk about editors and people will be free to show off some of the cool Python editing related features of their favorite editor/IDE.

In months past when we didn&#8217;t have a full schedule, we&#8217;ve still had plenty to talk about. The time is left open for any random Python question or quick topics that people want discuss. So, bring along your editor and any burning Python questions and join us!

(Meetings are free, and the meeting is at the Arbor Networks office in downtown Ann Arbor)
