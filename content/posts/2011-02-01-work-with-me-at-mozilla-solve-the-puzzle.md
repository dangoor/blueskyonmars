My first two years at Mozilla have been great fun and an amazingly positive experience. This year promises to be even more fun, where I define fun as going after [some ambitious goals][1]. This year, we&#8217;re going to be building some very cool tools and setting the stage to push the boundaries of web developer tools even farther in 2012.

Now is your chance to get in on the ground floor of this work. Be a [part of the open web][2] and help us make better tools. It doesn&#8217;t matter where you&#8217;re located&#8230; if you&#8217;re an amazing web developer or have deep developer tools knowledge, I want to talk to you.

There are two ways to apply:

  1. Read [the job posting][3] and apply normally
  2. [Solve the puzzle][4] for extra credit

I hope to hear from you!
