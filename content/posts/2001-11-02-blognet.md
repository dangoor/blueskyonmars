I&#8217;m going to try to hunt down and blog the things that I&#8217;ve missed over the past couple of weeks. How else can I remember them, if I don&#8217;t put them here?
  
One bit is that I announced the [BlogNet Meta-Project][1]. The purpose of the project is to get blogs talking directly to readers, and to have the readership share the load so that the blogs can truly scale.

I had some new thoughts on it last night, and I&#8217;m hoping to get a prototype client going sometime soon! (Now that that&#8217;s in writing, we&#8217;ll see how long it takes!)
