We have a child. We live in Michigan. We also like camping. Combine these three things, and you&#8217;ve got a pretty good recipe for someone (probably Crysania) havnig a run-in with poison ivy. If that happens, we probably wouldn&#8217;t complain about paying overnight shipping for [Zanfel][1]. That is assuming we&#8217;re not clever enough to order it beforehand.

**Update**: Since quite a few people seem to have landed here, I thought I&#8217;d provide a handy link to Amazon for this item.
