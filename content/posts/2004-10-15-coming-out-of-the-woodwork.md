As much of a nailbiter as the 2000 election was, I don&#8217;t think there was anywhere near the passion that you see in this election. People are [coming out][1] of the [woodwork][2] and [Leaning Into It][3] and making their voices heard.

I&#8217;ve written anti-Bush sentiments here before. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve written any pro-Kerry sentiments. Here&#8217;s one: Kerry is the right man for the job. He&#8217;s come across well in the debates, he knows the ropes in Washington and his policies are sensible.

_Either Kerry or Bush will be the president come January_. Sure, you can protest the Washington establishment and vote for Nader or Badnarik. The real establishment to protest is _the current administration_ that has done nearly all it could to make a mess these past four years. **Vote Kerry** to make a change.

Kerry has a lot stacked against him. I don&#8217;t think the stock market is going anywhere for a while (see Bull&#8217;s Eye Investing), and the Iraq situation is not going to be easy to disentangle. But, I am sure that Bush will do a far worse job. The next president will most likely choose at least one Supreme Court justice, and that&#8217;s another thing I don&#8217;t want to leave to Bush.

**Vote Kerry** on November 2nd.
