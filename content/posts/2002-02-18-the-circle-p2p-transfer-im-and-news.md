[The Circle][1] is a promising-sounding peer-to-peer decentralized content application. I haven&#8217;t been able to try it yet, so I&#8217;m not sure how far along it is. But, with file transfer, instant messaging and news, it sounds quite interesting. Possibly even the first implementation of a [blognet][2] that has been created.
