  * _07:59_ good coverage of Leopard features on AppleInsider. I&#8217;m looking forward to this upgrade! [#][1]
  * _09:36_ @[cleverdevil][2] spotlight in Leopard is supposed to be fast for app launching and even can calculate&#8230; but it can&#8217;t add to iGTD! [#][3]
  * _10:51_ @[cleverdevil][2] iGTD+quicksilver is very cool, fi you&#8217;ve never tried it. (the new Mail does todos now, so maybe iGTD won&#8217;t be as useful) [#][4]
  * _13:05_ Apple iPhone SDK: a good move, as long as Apple makes it frictionless for developers [#][5]
