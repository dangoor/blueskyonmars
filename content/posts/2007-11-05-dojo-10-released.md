I&#8217;m an early riser, usually starting work around 7AM Eastern. Today is no exception, despite the fact that this is my first day [at my new job][1]. I was surprised to find Alex Russell online when I started up this morning, but this explains it all: [Dojo 1.0 has been released][2]. Dojo 1.0 is huge (and yet compact&#8230; 23K core!) and powerful. Congrats to everyone who worked on this release!
