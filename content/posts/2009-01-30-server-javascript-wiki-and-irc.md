The server side web development chatter over the past few years has been centered around Ruby, Python, the latest frameworks in Java and Groovy, plus the endless swirl of activity in PHP. At least, that&#8217;s the chatter I&#8217;ve been seeing.

Clearly, there is pent up demand to make JavaScript into a not only competitive but truly awesome server side web dev environment. I launched the [ServerJS][1] mailing list yesterday and as of now it has 136 members and a lot of active discussion. This is a very promising start.

Of course, discussion is not the same as code. Luckily, there&#8217;s no shortage of code. It&#8217;s a matter of picking the _right_ code and sticking with it.

To help collect up all of the useful information that&#8217;s coming up, I have set up a wiki at Mozilla&#8217;s Developer Center:

[ServerJS &#8211; MDC][2]

At [Tom Robinson][3]&#8216;s suggestion, we are also meeting on IRC in #serverjs on freenode.

The energy behind this project is huge and I think a great new programming environment will ultimately emerge.
