Time has a nice article about [the changing consumerism in India][1]. Huge change is afoot indeed.

> The cutting edge of this consumer boom is on full display in Gurgaon, a satellite city south of New Delhi that is rapidly developing into mall-rat heaven. Since December, three mammoth, glitzy malls have opened their doors there, crammed with a collection of stores airlifted straight from America&#8217;s suburbs — Nike, Benetton, Pizza Hut, Subway sandwiches, even a showroom for Bose audio systems. Two multiplex theaters show such Hollywood hits as The Matrix Reloaded. Five more malls nearby are in the works.

The article also has some interesting bits about the steps McDonald&#8217;s has taken to cater to the crowd there:

> The best seller is the McAloo Tikki burger, a vegetarian fried-potato patty with cheese. The newest entry is the McCurry Pan, a flat pastry filled with hot broccoli or chicken curry.
