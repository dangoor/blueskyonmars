2008 is the first year in which I am eligible to run for President, so naturally I had planned to throw my hat into the ring. But, now that [Christopher Walken is running][1], I know that there&#8217;s no point ðŸ™‚

Still, it seems a little funny to think of [Zorin][2] as our President. Or Colonel Angus, for that matter.

Walken&#8217;s speeches would be great to listen to and watch, however.
