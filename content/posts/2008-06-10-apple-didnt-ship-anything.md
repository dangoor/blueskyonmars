I&#8217;m an Apple fanboy. Not for any religious reasons, mind you. I&#8217;m a fanboy because they&#8217;ve been doing an amazing job of design these past few years.

Yesterday was the latest of Steve Jobs&#8217; signature keynote addresses. I didn&#8217;t watch it, but I saw the play-by-play from MacRumors. I need not go into the details of what was announced, given that Apple gets millions in cheap publicity whenever Steve does one of these keynotes. As usual, the products look great, more revenue, profit and marketshare coming, yadda yadda.

I was disappointed, though, that Apple didn&#8217;t ship anything yesterday. It&#8217;s very hard to get your product plan to line up with a specific event like WWDC, and I&#8217;d be surprised if early product roadmaps pointed to a release at WWDC. In this case, there was the added complexity of the iPhone 3G requiring the iPhone 2.0 software and that it didn&#8217;t make sense to launch MobileMe without the iPhone 2.0 software. And the iPhone 2.0 software can&#8217;t launch until the AppStore is ready. That&#8217;s a lot of dependencies.

As a user of their products, I still would like to have had the iPhone 2.0 software now, though. The Apple of a couple years ago more often than not seemed to ship products on the day they were announced.
