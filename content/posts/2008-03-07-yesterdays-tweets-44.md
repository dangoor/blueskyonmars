  * _15:28_ iphone SDK sounds great. [#][1]
  * _16:10_ not surprised that Apple&#8217;s SDK site is entirely hosed. I briefly saw the page that mentions the options. [#][2]
  * _16:32_ Iphone sdk does not include beta firmware. So you can build cool apps that you can only play with in the emulator. [#][3]
