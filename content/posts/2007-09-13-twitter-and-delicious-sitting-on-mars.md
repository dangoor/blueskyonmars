I&#8217;ve had this blog since May 2001, which makes it the logical place for me to put something if I want to remember it publicly.

When [del.icio.us][1] came along, I thought it looked cool, but I really wanted to keep track of links I found interesting here, on Blue Sky On Mars. I would end up either with short blog posts that basically contain one link, or I would opt to not save the link at all. Somewhere along the way, though, del.icio.us had an update that allowed for automatic posting of the day&#8217;s links to your blog. This is great, because I get to centralize my interests here, but still use all of the del.icio.us tools.

As [Twitter][2] picked up steam early this year, I wasn&#8217;t sure what I would use it for or how it would fit into my little self-generated-content ecosystem. Now it seems like it has a logical place, just like del.icio.us does. Thanks to [Loud Twitter][3], my tweets will get posted here every day. So, just like del.icio.us is a way to post links that I find interesting but don&#8217;t have lots to say about, Twitter is a way for me to post snippets or ideas that are interesting but don&#8217;t quite get to the level of a blog posting.

I like these tools that will actually post to my blog, rather than just appearing in a box off to the side. Once the post lands on my blog, it&#8217;s in _my_ database and has become a part of history here at BSOM.

If you want to follow me on Twitter, [my username is dangoor][4]. I plan to stick mostly to tech, but will likely throw in some politics or entertainment bits from time to time. I will likely get other ideas about it as I start following other people there.

Gee, I guess I&#8217;m finally entering 2007 ðŸ™‚
