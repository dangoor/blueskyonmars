Finally, and with [typical slashdot fanfare][1], [Subversion 1.0][2] has been released. This is not your typical 1.0, because Subversion has been in development for a long time before being branded 1.0. There are already graphical clients and an Eclipse plugin. Let&#8217;s hope those mature quickly to be as seamless as their CVS counterparts, but with the great characteristics that Subversion brings (directory versioning, constant time tagging/branching, WebDAV, etc).
