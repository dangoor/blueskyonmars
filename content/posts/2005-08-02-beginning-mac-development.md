[TUAW][1] links to [Beginning Mac Development][2] and [Mac OS X Tiger for Developers][3], two articles by Justin Williams that look (on the surface) like nicely-written intros. I have not yet read them, so I can&#8217;t say how they are beyond the surface, but I wanted to keep track for later reading.

(This kind of thing is also of value to PyObjC developers and even those who want to use Java with native Mac features.)
