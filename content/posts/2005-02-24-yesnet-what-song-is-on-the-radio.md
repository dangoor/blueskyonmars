In some ways, it looks like the &#8220;search&#8221; feature is an afterthought. But, [#YES][1] has a cool search feature that&#8217;s worth knowing about. Select your local radio station and the time, and you can find out the name and artist of the song that&#8217;s playing. Useful thing if you listen to the radio and want to track something down later.
