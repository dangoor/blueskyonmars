If you haven&#8217;t already seen it, you should check out the [screencast][1] for the online marking tool that [Greg Wilson&#8217;s][2] group made. Very slick stuff, and I wish the graders had a tool like that when I was in school.

Oprius has posted [three new screencasts][3] of their slick Foundations package.

Finally, the good folks of ShowMeDo have pointed me to a page to [request TurboGears screencasts.][4] Put in a call for your topic of choice.
