Thanks for Spam Karma 2 and WordPress&#8217; built in anti-spam features, I don&#8217;t have much of a problem with comment spam these days. It looks like Blogger must still be dealing with it, though. As far as I know, they&#8217;ve always required you to sign in to post a comment. Apparently, that&#8217;s not enough, though. Now you have to log in _and_ respond to a CAPTCHA. Gadzooks. I&#8217;ll stop posting comments on Blogger sites when they require a blood sample for verification.
