I thought it would be worthwhile to post a note about the first meeting of [the Michigan Python Users Group][1], which was last night.

Including myself, we had 11 in attendance, which I thought was quite good! The mailing list is up to 26 members, so all in all we&#8217;re off to a good start membership-wise.

The members that were present last night have varying levels of Python experience and have used different combinations of tools. So, there&#8217;s a whole bunch we can profitably talk about. As a sign of the fact that there was plenty to talk about, the meeting ran for 2 hours.

Steve Kryskalla gave a good presentation showing off how easy it is to generate graphics on-the-fly using PIL with standard Python CGI. I haven&#8217;t needed to generate images in Python, so seeing PIL&#8217;s API up close was interesting for me.

I&#8217;m going to skip talking about my presentation for now.

Mark Ramm hosted us at the [Humantech][2] office, which is very nice and has an excellent meeting room for this type of meeting. We didn&#8217;t make too much of a mess and Mark has invited us back next month.

So, if you&#8217;re in southeastern lower Michigan and have Python topics you&#8217;d like to toss around with others, now is a great time to [join the mailing list][1]! We&#8217;ll be starting to decide next month&#8217;s agenda soon, I&#8217;d imagine.
