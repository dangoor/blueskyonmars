The big geek news of the day is definitely that [SpaceShipOne Wins $10 Million Ansari X Prize in Historic 2nd Trip to Space][1]. Given that it cost $20-30 million to fund the missions, it&#8217;s definitely not the prize money that&#8217;s a factor. It&#8217;s being able to say that you ushered in commercial space flight. Time will tell, but this is quite possibly one of those milestones that will be remembered for generations.
