Keanu Reeves has a deal that gets him 15% of the gross receipts of Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions. Plus, he&#8217;ll likely get something from the undoubtedly huge video sales to come. He&#8217;s likely to make [a minimum of $150 million][1] for the two theatrical releases. Realizing that this is way more money than he needs, Keanu is [giving away £50 million][2]. 

> His gift to the Matrix series&#8217; 29 behind-the-scenes whiz-kids will see each of them receiving £1.75 million.

Costume designers and special effects folks will each be getting a lot more than they&#8217;re used to. That is some really great generosity.
