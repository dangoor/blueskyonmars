Ann Arbor is a great place in the summer. Beautiful weather (though it is as hot as it looks in these pictures!), fun festivals like Top of the Park and the Art Fair. There&#8217;s also a carnival that comes through on 4th of July weekend and takes over a good portion of Pioneer High School&#8217;s parking lot. It&#8217;s odd to think that I can just walk over and pick up elephant ears or a funnel cake on my way home from work, since I park in that parking lot.
