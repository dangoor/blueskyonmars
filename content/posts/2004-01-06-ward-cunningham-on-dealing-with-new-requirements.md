Via [Bill de hÃ“ra][1], here&#8217;s an interview with Ward Cunningham: [Working the Program][2]. A great bit on how you accomplish emergent design:

> But the nature of the work is first changing the program so the new requirement is an easy fit, and then doing the easy work to incorporate the requirement. In other words, instead of patching the new requirement onto an architecture that was not made to accommodate it, just buckle down and do the hard work to change the architecture so the requirement is easy to implement.
