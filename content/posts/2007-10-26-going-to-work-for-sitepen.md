I&#8217;m excited to announce that starting November 5th, I&#8217;ll be working for [SitePen][1]. Never heard of SitePen? That&#8217;s not surprising. But, if you&#8217;re involved in web development, you&#8217;ve likely heard of the [Dojo JavaScript Toolkit][2]. Alex Russell, Director of R&D at SitePen, is the leader of the Dojo Core project and SitePen&#8217;s CEO, Dylan Schiemann is also a JavaScript fiend who has been involved with Dojo for a long time.

I responded to Alex&#8217;s blog posting for a [&#8220;Sweet Gig&#8221;][3], which is indeed a very cool and unusual opportunity. I met with Dylan and Alex out in Santa Clara just before AjaxWorld, which I unfortunately couldn&#8217;t attend. A couple days after our meeting, Dylan offered me a position that, for me, is even cooler than the R&D sweet gig.

People who know me or have read my blog for some length of time know that I&#8217;m a &#8220;product guy&#8221;. If you look at SitePen&#8217;s website, you&#8217;ll see that SitePen is a web consulting business. I&#8217;ve done that kind of work in the past, and while there are plusses to that kind of business, it&#8217;s not what I like to do.

Dylan has opened up a slot for me doing a combination of &#8220;product promotion/product development/R&D&#8221;. My job title for the moment is &#8220;product manager&#8221;, because that&#8217;s the closest fit to what I&#8217;ll be doing, but the position is really a lot more open and cool than that. Basically, I&#8217;m going to work with Dylan, Alex and the others at SitePen to build neat products and scalable services.

With its ties to Dojo, SitePen is obviously a very open source friendly environment, and they&#8217;re very committed to the open web. I think there&#8217;s a terrific opportunity to build new products and services within this environment.

So, what will these new products and services be? Great question. I&#8217;ll let you know once I figure that out ðŸ˜‰

Greetings to my new colleagues at SitePen, and a [&#8220;fare thee well&#8221; to my friends at Arbor Networks][4].
