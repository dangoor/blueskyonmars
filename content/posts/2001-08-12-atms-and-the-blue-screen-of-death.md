The Industry Standard reports that [ATMs may get smarter][1]. &#8220;Smarter&#8221; is defined in this article as using fancy new software that runs under NT instead of the aging OS/2. Is it me, or does NT seem to be the wrong choice for a device like an ATM? It&#8217;s quite beefy and was not known for its stability. Windows 2000 is much better in terms of stability, but I still think Linux is a better choice for a special purpose device like an ATM.

Anyhow, I hope someone will report on it the first time they walk up to an ATM and see the infamous Blue Screen of Death :).
