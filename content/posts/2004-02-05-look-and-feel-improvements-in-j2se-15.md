Brian Duff talks about the new [Look and Feel features in J2SE 1.5][1]. I didn&#8217;t even realize that they had made these improvements! Very nice, since I&#8217;m doing Swing right now. Of course, you can bet that I haven&#8217;t been using the awful Metal look and feel. Plastic (from JGoodies) and Skin L&F are both quite cool.
