In a discussion of &#8220;Remind&#8221; over at 43 Folders, there as mention of [GeekTool][1] which lets you put the output of unix commands on your desktop and [Witch][2] which provides an easy way to switch between _all_ of your running windows with just your keyboard. I don&#8217;t need GeekTool right now, so i&#8217;ll keep a bookmark here. But, I&#8217;m going to give Witch a whirl.
