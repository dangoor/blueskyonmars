Gary Robinson, the head of [Emergent Music][1] has an article on his blog about the [Three Steps To Freedom][2]. His opinion on this definitely counts, because EM might very well be the future of music. I&#8217;m going to chime in with my thoughts here and copy them over to EM&#8217;s forum as well.

There are a couple of things that major labels have traditionally done:

  * Paid cash up front to make high-quality recordings
  * Promote the music to get it in front of large quantities of people

While people may question the quality of the pop music released by the majors, I don&#8217;t think you can question the quality of the _recordings_. They are slick, well-produced, well-mixed and well-mastered. This particular service of the majors is becoming less important because of inexpensive, high-quality recording gear. To some extent, increasingly intelligent software is even making mastering engineers less crucial. I&#8217;ve got a decent home studio, and creating a similar studio today would be dramatically less expensive than it was a few years back.

The second part, promoting the music, is where EM is looking to fit in (and take over!). The current promotion system is broken because it costs a fortune and leaves a lot of great music unheard.

I agree with Gary&#8217;s 3 steps, except I don&#8217;t fully agree with the third. The first two steps: building a large pool of music that steers you toward music you like, and making that music convenient to download are right on. Setting up a subscription service to reward the artists, however, is not necessarily the winning model.

Right now, the offerings from PressPlay, MusicNet and Emusic are all subscription-based. Ignoring the fact that PressPlay and MusicNet have ridiculous DRM and Emusic has no filtering that I&#8217;m aware of, I still have a problem with those services as subscription offerings. Why? Because I don&#8217;t think there will ever be a single site that has all of the music that I could want and I don&#8217;t want to have to spend $70 a month subscribing to different services for the freedom to download the songs that I like.

What I would like to see is a site that offers both models: subscription and a la carte purchases. If I come to the site, preview a song and decide that I really like it, I&#8217;d like to be able to pay $0.25 or $0.50 to download a good MP3 of that song. I realize that current payment systems make charges that small impractical, so I&#8217;d be willing to prepay a few dollars (say $5) for some number of credits. That works great for a site that has some music that I like but that I&#8217;m not so avid a fan that I&#8217;m willing to sign up for recurring fees. Some day, we may even get real micropayment systems that allow for inexpensive, per-song purchases.

However, when I do find a site that regularly offers lots of good music that I really enjoy, I may sign up (and it may be financially beneficial to me to sign up, if I can download a greater number of songs through the subscription price).

I&#8217;ve thought about this topic quite a bit, and believe that easy, DRM-free music downloads are the future. I can&#8217;t wait to get there, because I feel that the artists are the ones getting shafted the most right now and I want to see them break free from the past.
