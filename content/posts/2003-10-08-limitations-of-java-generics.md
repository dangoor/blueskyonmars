Merrick Schincariol wrote a detailed article about [what Java&#8217;s generics lack that C++&#8217;s have.][1] This really doesn&#8217;t surprise me a whole lot, given that the C++ folks are fine with multiple inheritance and the Java folks thought that was too complicated.

As Merrick points out, though, at least Java collections will be less painful to use.
