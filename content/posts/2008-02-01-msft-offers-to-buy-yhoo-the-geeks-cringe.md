This morning, [Microsoft offered $44 billion to buy Yahoo!][1]. Years ago, Microsoft bought HotMail. At the time, HotMail&#8217;s servers were all running FreeBSD. Somewhere along the way, the transitioned all of HotMail&#8217;s servers over to Windows.

What would it do to Yahoo!&#8217;s tech culture to make a complete shift to Windows? I can&#8217;t imagine it would be good.
