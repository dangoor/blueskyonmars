For some time, I&#8217;ve thought that many applications written as native applications for many different platforms could be done just as well as cross-platform web applications. I understand why people would make a unit conversion sort of application as a native iOS app, to give one example, but I&#8217;ve thought it&#8217;s a shame.

Some others within Mozilla gathered up a lot of opinions, put in a bunch of thought and then put together a prototype which they&#8217;ve announced today: [Prototype of an Open Web App Ecosystem][1].

This is _really_ cool. They&#8217;ve come up with a good solution that is truly open along every axis. Anyone can build apps and sell them through any channel (including their own!). This is the way apps _should_ work.

Most &#8220;app store&#8221; designs lock people into a platform. It&#8217;s great to see an alternative ecosystem without the lock in.
