Congrats to the [Eclipse team][1] for shipping 3.0, a most excellent upgrade over 2.1. I&#8217;ve been slavishly following the 3.0 milestone releases. Each milestone had a good number of new features. Sure, there were bugs, but there was only one release (M6) which caused me too much trouble to continue using.
