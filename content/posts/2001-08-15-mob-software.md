Slashdot mentioned this rather long, interesting piece about [Mob Software][1]. This article was written by Dick Gabriel, who is apparently a well-known programmer going way back. This article was originally from the OOSPLA 2000 conference, and the discussion mentioned another article
  
[(Agent-Oriented Software Engineering)][2] that looks interesting.

I haven&#8217;t read the second one yet, and I haven&#8217;t decided if I agree with the first one. I will say that I do agree with the idea of making programming accessible to as many people as possible&#8230;
