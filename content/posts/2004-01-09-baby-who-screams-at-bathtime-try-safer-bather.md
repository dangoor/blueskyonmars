I just had to put in a plug for the <a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JIVI/blueskyonmars-20">Safer Bather</a>. Initially, Crysania seemed mildly wary of bathtime, but was generally okay. Somewhere around 3-4 months, she became _really_ loud at bathtime. It was to the point that I was going to start wearing earplugs. Since we started using the Safer Bather, she&#8217;s been a lot happier in the bath.

For reference, we had been using an infant tub before. I have a feeling that she was getting cold in the old tub. The Safer Bather keeps her warm because the water seeps into it.
