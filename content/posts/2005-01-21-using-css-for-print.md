Another good one from Slashdot. [XML.com: Printing XML: Why CSS Is Better than XSL][1]. Of course, it would be nice web browsers supported all of the CSS printing goodness that they outline. On the positive side, in the comments someone mentions [css2xslfo][2]. Ironically, this converts your nice, concise CSS to the very format that the authors are blasting. However, XSL-FO can produce nice output, and it can do it today. So, having a free tool to produce good PDFs out of your HTML/CSS is a bonus.
