Earlier this week, it was announced that Amazon.com is running an auction of the [first three Segway transporters][1]. When I looked at the time, they were each going for around $13,000. Now, they range from $86,000-$150,000. I&#8217;m not sure why there is such a large range. That&#8217;s a pretty staggering figure, and will be good for Dean Kamen&#8217;s FIRST charity. The auction still has a few weeks to go, so we&#8217;ll see where the bidding goes.
