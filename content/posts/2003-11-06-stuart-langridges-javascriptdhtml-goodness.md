Stuart Langridge&#8217;s [browser experiments][1] provide some nifty, unobtrusive bits to spruce up web apps. They include sortable tables, drop shadows, and expandable tree menus. At least one of the scripts is explicitly stated as being available under an MIT license. The other scripts are less clear.
  
Update: Just came across [another sortable table][2] that apparently works in any modern browser.
