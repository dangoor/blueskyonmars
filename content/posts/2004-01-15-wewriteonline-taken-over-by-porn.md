Weird. It&#8217;s been a while since this blog became Blue Sky On Mars. Prior to that, it was WeWriteOnline.org. I didn&#8217;t think there were really that many links into that site, or that many people reading it. Blue Sky On Mars has been the most popular incarnation of this blog (which was started in June 2001).

So, I let the WeWriteOnline.org domain name lapse. Oddly enough, the domain name was then registered by a porn site. Also strange is that a Google search for &#8220;Kevin Dangoor&#8221; yields a link to that site on the first page. I guess this is a lesson that it&#8217;s better to spend the $8 to keep the domain name going than to let it lapse.
