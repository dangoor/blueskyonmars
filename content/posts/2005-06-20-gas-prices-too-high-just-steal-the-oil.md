I&#8217;d just like to draw some added attention to the commenter on [this post][1] who is seriously that we just take the oil from Iraq to reduce our gas prices. I thought it was a troll, but apparently that&#8217;s not the case. Check it out!

(Curiously, the commenter in question, Kyle, appears to be from a &#8220;blue state&#8221; based on his domain name.)
