My blog is about to enter a new phase. After a month [at my new job][1], I&#8217;m getting pretty well settled in and unwound from my last job. I&#8217;m back creating software and I&#8217;m enjoying it. This is a good thing for me right now. At some point in time, I&#8217;d like to move back into management, but for now I&#8217;m content to do good things in creating software for my customers.

Within three months, I&#8217;ll be a father. The change in job was a big deal, but can hardly compare with the change that is coming.

So, here I am, blogging again. Since I&#8217;m taking the bus once more, I should have a decent chance to write a few bits here and there. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll necessarily write every day, but that&#8217;s not always necessary to have a site [that&#8217;s worth reading][2].

In line with a bunch of factors, I&#8217;m thinking that I&#8217;m going to give my blog a bit of a facelift. My plan is to upgrade to [Drupal][3] 4.1, switch to a different domain that&#8217;s more fun, change to a new layout that makes better use of CSS and see about having a one-day-at-a-time format for the front page.
