<img class="aligncenter" title="Collaboration screen shot" src="http://bengalbraith.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/collab.png?w=500" alt="" width="499" height="405" />I work in Mozilla&#8217;s Developer Tools Lab, where we&#8217;re working to make things easier for web developers and to explore what is possible using open web tools. It turns out there&#8217;s quite a bit that&#8217;s possible, and we&#8217;ve just scratched the surface with what we&#8217;ve done with [Bespin][1] so far.

I&#8217;m really happy with the team that I&#8217;m working with, both within Mozilla Labs and in the Bespin community. I&#8217;m also really happy to report that we&#8217;ve got an opening on our team! We&#8217;re looking for fantastic software engineer that will own the Canvas-based editor component that is at the heart of Bespin.

We&#8217;d love to talk to you!
