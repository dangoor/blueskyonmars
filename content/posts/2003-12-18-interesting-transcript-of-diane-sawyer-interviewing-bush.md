LiberalOasis has [a transcript of part of Diane Sawyer&#8217;s interview with Bush][1]. Clearly, you know what kind of slant a site like &#8220;LiberalOasis&#8221; would have. Anyhow, it&#8217;s interesting to read what Bush does when being dogged about the lack of evidence of actual weapons of mass destruction.
