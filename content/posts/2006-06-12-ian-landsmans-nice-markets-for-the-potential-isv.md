[Ian Landsman&#8217;s Nice Markets for the Potential ISV][1] is a great post, if you&#8217;re looking for ideas of viable businesses to get into. It&#8217;s interesting to note that real estate is in a bubble right now, and times are likely to get tougher. That can actually create good opportunity if you can show someone how your product makes them more competitive.

Ian&#8217;s list focuses a lot on specific markets, and that&#8217;s definitely a good way to go in general. Successfully marketing a product is at least as hard as making it. If you make a broad product, you can live on a teeny tiny slice of the market, but you still need to somehow reach those people, and that can be expensive in a broad market.

If you&#8217;re thinking of doing any of these things, here&#8217;s an interesting tip (I don&#8217;t remember where I first heard it, unfortunately): create a product data sheet first and send it to prospective customers. It&#8217;s a fairly quick and easy way to check that you&#8217;re creating something that they&#8217;d buy. And, you&#8217;ve got one piece of your marketing material done already once the product is built ðŸ™‚
