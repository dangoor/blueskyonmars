Artima is carrying an article by Guido van Rossum with his thoughts on [Adding Optional Static Typing to Python][1]. Python can already act [like Prolog][2] if you want it to, so why not have it act like Java as well, if you wish&#8230;

A bit more seriously, though, the issues that Guido raises are quite sticky. As he points out, with tools like PyChecker, the number of errors that static typing will catch is fairly small. Is it worth going through the machinations of adding that much syntax to make static typing possible? Perhaps time would be better spent on the modules or other enhancements.
