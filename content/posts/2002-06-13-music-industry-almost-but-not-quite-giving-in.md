According to [this article][1], two of the major labels (Sony and Universal) are planning to offer downloaded singles for $0.99. The article says that in addition to the price cut, the major breakthrough is that these songs can be burned to CD. To which I say: almost but not quite. I want MP3 files, not Liquid Audio files. Sure, I can burn the Liquid files to CD and then rip them into MP3 format, but that means using lossy compression twice on the music, thus sacrificing sound quality.

A few days ago, I mentioned that a major was releasing an MP3 single&#8230; that&#8217;s the way to go. I will pay $0.99 for a song I really like.
