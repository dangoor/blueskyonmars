There&#8217;s an interesting set of blog entries by Steve Pavlina in which he talks about some transitions that he&#8217;s been making in his life. In [Environmental Reinforcement of Your Goals][1], Steve talks about how he&#8217;s conciously moving his career to speaking and writing, and has severed ties that he had to previous communities. This includes the Association of Shareware Professionals, where Steve was President a few years back. That and sidelining the business that he has built over the past few years is a powerful statement about his convictions in his new direction.

Ironically, reading Steve&#8217;s articles led me to join the ASP. This article doesn&#8217;t make me want to leave the ASP, of course. In fact, in reinforces that the ASP is a good tie for me to have. I&#8217;ve already learned some valuable things that I will apply in my new business.
