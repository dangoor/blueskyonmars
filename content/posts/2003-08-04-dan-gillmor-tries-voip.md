Dan Gillmor of the SJMerc wrote about [why he likes internet phone calling][1]. There&#8217;s some interesting discussion of [Free World Dialup][2], and how you can connect some of these VOIP phone systems to FWD giving you a real, live phone number to your computer. This type of stuff will be increasingly cool for businesses (think of companies like JetBlue where all of their call center people work from home!)
