It&#8217;s great to see an article like [The Tyranny of Copyright?][1] in the mainstream press (NYTimes in this case). Most people are probably not aware of the culture theft that is going on. It&#8217;s unfortunate that they use the term Copy Left to represent this &#8220;movement&#8221;, because the FSF which coined the term &#8220;copyleft&#8221; is far anti-copyright. The folks like Lessig and myself are pro-reasonable copyright.
