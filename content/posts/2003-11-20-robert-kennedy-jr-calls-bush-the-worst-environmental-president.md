This makes it seem rather remarkable that the Republicans dropped the drilling of Alaska. [Salon.com | Save the Earth &#8212; dump Bush][1] is an interview of Robert Kennedy Jr.

> The NRDC Web site lists over 200 environmental rollbacks by the White House in the last two years. If even a fraction of those are actually implemented, we will effectively have no significant federal environmental law left in our country by this time next year. That&#8217;s not exaggeration, it&#8217;s not hyperbole, it is a fact.

Scary stuff. It has been clear to me that Bush has been selling away the environment, but I didn&#8217;t realize how far he&#8217;s going. I do remember a recent headline saying that the Big 3 automakers were getting some fuel economy concessions. I guess Bush never met a dollar, I mean industrialist, that he doesn&#8217;t like.
