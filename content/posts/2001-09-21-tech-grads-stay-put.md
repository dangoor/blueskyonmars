The Detroit Free Press has an article about people going to school in Michigan and [staying here][1]. They quote some guy named &#8220;Kevin Diangoor&#8221;, which is really close to my name. To his credit, the reporter (Jeff Bennett) did spell Surekha&#8217;s name correctly. Thanks for the mention, Jeff! And it&#8217;s good to see that people are staying in Michigan.
