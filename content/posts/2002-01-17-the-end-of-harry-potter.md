**New here?** This post gets a fair bit of search engine traffic. I just wanted to note that it was written in 2002. It&#8217;s obviously outrageously wrong. Who cares? I was just having some fun. Read on&#8230;

J.K. Rowling told reporters that she has already written the final chapter of book 7 of Harry Potter. The chapter tells of what happens to the main characters after graduation. This is doubtless going to be one of the most sought after documents on the Net, and there will be many fake variations that surface. I thought I would make a pre-emptive strike and release my version of the last chapter of Harry Potter. Feel free to post a link to your own Potter final chapters.

Harry Potter and the Legend of Sawtooth (Book 7)

Chapter 65 &#8211; The End

And with that, Harry Potter&#8217;s notable career at Hogwarts was officially at an end. Harry and his friends will always look back at these seven years as having been among the best they&#8217;ve had.

Harry&#8217;s fond memories of Hogwarts were not overshadowed by the dark experiences he had had to face. They also weren&#8217;t ruined by thoughts of summers at the Dursleys. His time at Hogwarts was so liberating compared to living at the Dursleys that Hogwarts stands out in vibrant detail because of the contrast.

The Dursleys were pleased to finally be rid of Harry. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia broke down to tears when their son Dudley left for junior college. After an undistinguished two years at the college, Dudley started his undistinguished career selling insurance. He was keenly aware that he had not treated Harry well, and that Harry could now use magic as much as he liked. To this day, he periodically glances over his shoulder, fearing that Harry will be standing there, wand upraised, casting some spell that will turn him into a toad. This hasn&#8217;t happened, yet.

With the Malfoy family fortune greatly in decline, Draco Malfoy was forced to go out and earn his living after Hogwarts. His attempts to get a job in the Ministry of Magic failed time and again, for reasons that will become clear soon. He ended up owning a shop in Nocturne Alley buying and selling dark magic items.

Much as he disliked Harry, Severus Snape finally admitted that Harry was a pretty good wizard after all. Snape was finally given the Defense Against the Dark Arts post after years of trying, and that put him in a particularly lighter mood. He felt like he was almost going to miss Harry. Almost.

Albus Dumbledore could hardly have been more proud of his students. After his long years as a well-respected wizard and Headmaster of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he knew it was time to retire and get some rest. With Voldemort vanquished at last, he had no more fears about the safety of his students.

Minerva McGonagoll was tempted to retire as well, but she enjoyed being the head of Gryffindor house entirely too much for that. Her Transfiguration class continues to be one of the most difficult classes at Hogwarts to this day.

The statue of Hagrid kept his memory with the Hogwarts students for years to come. Over time, Hagrid&#8217;s deeds were embellished to the point where Hagrid was said to have single-handedly held off an army of trolls, dragons, and Lord Voldemort himself for hours as the wizards got their act together. His pet dragon Norbert has often made a stop at Hogwarts to look at the statue of Hagrid, who had raised him in his earliest days. Harry would also come back to Hogwarts to see the school and the statue which reminded him of his old friend who had done so much for him.

The Weasleys, who were once scorned by the wealthier wizards because of their relative lack of wealth, finally came into their own. Most thought that if any wealth came to the Weasleys, it would come from Charlie or Percy who were both near the tops of their classes. But, it was the troublemakers Fred and George that hit it big. The shop that they had opened right after graduation, Weasley Brothers Spellbinding Novelties and Magical Jokes, had been such a huge hit with the students of Hogwarts that the professors were seriously considering restricting trips to Hogsmeade. The second Weasley Brothers location in Diagon Alley was an even greater success.

Ron Weasley decided to head to Romania and learn how to fight dragons from his brother Charlie. After facing his first couple of real dragons, he decided that dragon hunting wasn&#8217;t his bag of tricks. His bag of tricks, in fact, happened to be tricks. He became a master joke maker and the third partner in Weasley Brothers.

Hermione Granger went on to enjoy a stellar career in wizard academia, eventually becoming the Headmistress of Hogwarts. Her books eventually came to outsell even those of Gilderoy Lockhart. Those books appear in the &#8220;p&#8217; sections of the library, for Hermione Potter.

After leaving Hogwarts, Harry and Hermione had gone their separate ways. Hermione went on to the prestigious London Institute of Magical Research and Harry went straight into the Ministry of Magic. Though they often got on each other&#8217;s nerves, Harry and Hermione realized that they were much happier together, and got married after Hermione finished her schooling. Headmistress Hermione Potter and Minister of Magic Harry Potter could not have been happier.

Compared to the excitement and adventure of his childhood, Harry&#8217;s career in the Ministry of Magic was downright boring. With Voldemort vanquished, dark magic became far less popular, and the wizard population was more peaceful than it had been in generations. Harry was pleased to have had a hand in making the world a better place for his children. Little did he know that his children would face their own unique challenges&#8230;
