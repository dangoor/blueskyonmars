Last night was the third [a2div][1] meeting. [Majd Taby][2] spoke about [SproutCore][3] at the inaugural meeting in September, and I spoke about [CommonJS][4] in October. November&#8217;s meeting, which was to be about [Google&#8217;s Closure][5] library, was canceled because of a confluence of factors&#8230; Three JS talks in a row led [Trek Glowacki][6] [to declare that][7]

> so far a2 <div> has turned out to be &#8220;A2 Javascript Lovefest&#8221;

While I certainly like JavaScript, that wasn&#8217;t intentional. We have to run with what people want to hear and are willing to talk about. Luckily for us, Trek himself was prepared to do something about it and gave a great talk last night about [Heroku][8].

Trek had a demo ready to go, involving getting the [open source code][9] for [RubyFlow][10] running and customized. He had a neat way of doing the demo without resorting to live coding: he had the demo code in a git repository with separate branches for each step of the demo. It worked quite well and Heroku looks awesome. [Video of the demo][11] is available online.

In the loosely structured part of the meeting that followed, we had bits of discussion about a few different things, including a quick demo of [Node.js][12] by Majd. We also talked about what topics we&#8217;d like to hear more about in future meetings. Here&#8217;s the list that came up:

  * Comparison of NoSQL engines
  * Node.js or other Comet serving technologies
  * The Microsoft stack for web development ([Jay Harris][13] offered to talk on this topic)
  * Something involving designers + programmers (maybe even a &#8220;basic principles of design&#8221; intro to help us avoid creating designs with misaligned bits and eye bleed inducing colors)

The January meeting will be at its usual time and place (January 28th, 7PM, [SRT Solutions][14]). Topic to be decided.

Thanks to Trek for a great meeting at the spiffy [Workantile Exchange][15]!
