[ZVTM][1] is a Zoomable user interface toolkit for Java. One of the example applications put forth is [IsaViz][2], an RDF editor that represents RDF as a directed graph. I&#8217;ve always thought that the RDF XML syntax was more than a little unwieldy for normal humans, so IsaViz seems like a great tool.
