I just came across the [FormLayoutMaker project][1] which provides a visual editor for the JGoodies Forms layout package. This looks like a handy way to set things up. Though FormLayout is the nicest LayoutManager to use by hand, sometimes it gets a little painful to make changes to your CellConstraints by hand.
