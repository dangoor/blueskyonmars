Wow. I&#8217;ve been out of the loop a bit for a few days. I just discovered that Yahoo! has bought Konfabulator and released it for free as [Yahoo! Widgets][1]. For those not familiar, Konfabulator is basically the same as Dashboard on Mac OS X Tiger. The biggest difference is that Dashboard uses Expose to zoom on and off screen, and Konfabulator widgets sit around on your desktop all the time.

The other big difference is that Konfabulator is also available for Windows! Nice move on Yahoo!&#8217;s part.

Now if only someone would get [Quicksilver][2] ported to Windows.
