[ZDNet UK reports that Microsoft has rigged an online poll][1]. Actually, what it&#8217;s really saying is that Microsoft sent an internal email urging people to vote, and some people tried to vote many times. The poll was asking what technology people would use to implement web services. Most people had been saying Java, until the microsoft.com domain weighed in.
