If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet, you really should watch the demo of [280Atlas][1]. It&#8217;s basically [Interface Builder][2] written for the browser. Just watch their demo and tell me that that doesn&#8217;t look like a great way to build webapps (and I do mean _apps_ and not sites).

A lot of work goes into _designing_ good software. [280North][3] are taking the great design work put in on Apple&#8217;s developer tools and making it available to people building browser-based apps. They&#8217;ve saved themselves the work of inventing every little piece of the model, instead focusing on the work of making it work well in JavaScript.

Awesome work, guys!
