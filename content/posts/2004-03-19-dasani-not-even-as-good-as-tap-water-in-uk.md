Recently, it was reported that Coca-Cola&#8217;s Dasani brand of bottled water is purified tap water in the UK (and most other countries). Now comes news of a [recall of Dasani water in the UK][1]

> The Coca-Cola Co said on Friday it had recalled its entire Dasani range of bottled water from the British market after levels of bromate, a potentially harmful chemical, were found to exceed legal standards.

Oops. Many people buy bottled water with the thought that it is healthier than their tap water. This is not always the case&#8230;
