As an experiment, I had switched to using Firefox once FF3 was released. I like the Awesome Bar, and the browser definitely feels a bit peppier than Firefox 2. The biggest advantage Firefox 2 has over Safari remains: the add-ons.

However, Safari feels so much faster than Firefox that I&#8217;m switching back because I find the basic browsing experience to be nicer. I still have Firefox around for the times when I really want to use one of the extensions&#8230; but the most important extension, Firebug, has been ably duplicated in WebKit&#8217;s debugger.

If you&#8217;re a web developer using the Mac, give the WebKit nightly a try and see what _you_ think.

Update: I also wanted to note that I&#8217;ve noticed playing Flash videos in Firefox 3 was choppy. I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s to blame (Flash or Firefox), but it works fine in Safari.
