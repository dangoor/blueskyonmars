How about this news: [CIA Reportedly Halts Use of Harsh Interrogation Ploys][1]

> The CIA (news &#8211; web sites) has stopped using interrogation techniques such as &#8220;stress positions,&#8221; sleep deprivation and denial of pain medication while the Bush administration reviews their legality, The Washington Post said Sunday.

Doesn&#8217;t that seem a bit odd? Let&#8217;s do something we&#8217;re not quite sure is legal, and then when people find out we&#8217;ll stop and check to see if it&#8217;s actually legal. And, I thought that&#8217;s what that whole long paper that leaked a few weeks back was about: administration lawyers believe that such things are legal.
