A few years ago, I clued [Vincent Flanders][1] in on a few outrageous websites. One of Vincent&#8217;s big categories of site suckage is Mystery Meat Navigation, where the site provides unlabeled pictures as a navigational &#8220;aid&#8221;. Today I came across [Fuddruckers : World&#8217;s Greatest Hamburgers][2]. Here&#8217;s my message to Vincent:

To their credit, they do provide non-mysterious links at the bottom. The part that really got me, though, was the giant picture of a hamburger. Apparently, their restaurants are the mystery meat. Their menu is a little cheesy. Their jobs are spicy. And their franchise opportunities give you bad breath.
