The very fact that ATHENS 2004 even has a [Hyperlink Policy][1] shows that they&#8217;re a bit out of touch. I thought that stuff had already made its way through the courts? It&#8217;s craziness. They certainly can put (some) restrictions on the use of their trademark, but trying to restrict links is an amusing bit.
