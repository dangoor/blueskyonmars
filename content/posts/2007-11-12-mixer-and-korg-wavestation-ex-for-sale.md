OK, I promise that my blog is not going to just be filled with ads for random stuff that I&#8217;m selling. I actually have a programming-related article planned for sometime soon. In the meantime, though, hot on the heels of listing my desk on craigslist, I now have a [DOD 1642 16-Channel Professional Sound Mixing Board][1] and a [Korg Wavestation EX keyboard][2] for sale. Some people on eBay have started calling the Wavestation &#8220;vintage&#8221;. It&#8217;s always kind of scary when something that you bought new is now categorized as vintage. Alas, I&#8217;m old enough now that a fair number of things we&#8217;ve purchased over the years could qualify as vintage had I kept them. (TRS-80 Model III, anyone?)
