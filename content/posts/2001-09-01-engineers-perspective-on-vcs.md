IEEE Spectrum has the [engineer&#8217;s perspective on VCs][1]. Clearly, not all VCs are as described here. However, in anything you do, it&#8217;s good to be aware of what motivates the people you&#8217;re dealing with. VCs are compensated (and motivated) to have good returns for their venture funds. Gee whiz technology doesn&#8217;t mean much to them, unless it will lead to financial rewards for the fund.

There may be the occasional venture fund that is run by a technologist, but I think those are few and far between.
