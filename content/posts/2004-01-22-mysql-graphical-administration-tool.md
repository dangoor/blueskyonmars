Sure, there are plenty of web and rich client GUIs for managing MySQL, but none look as spiffy as MySQL AB&#8217;s just announced [MySQL Administrator][1]. That looks very slick, and I think the timing is good as MySQL&#8217;s feature set grows to handle more &#8220;enterprise class&#8221; applications. GPL/commercial license, soon to be available for Windows and Linux.
