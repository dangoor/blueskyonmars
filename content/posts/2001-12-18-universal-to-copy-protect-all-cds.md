By mid-2002, [Universal][1] will be copy protecting all of their CDs. These discs supposedly will play fine in standard CD players, but will not work in other devices such as PCs and Sony PS2s. I have zero doubt that people will work around this (though that might be a violation of the DMCA). I rip all of my CDs for personal use at home on our server and in my Nomad Jukebox, and I won&#8217;t support record labels that want to remove that capability.
