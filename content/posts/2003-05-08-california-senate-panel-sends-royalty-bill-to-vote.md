Against record industry opposition, [the California Senate Judiciary Committee OKed a new music royalty measure][1]. The bill makes record companies responsible for accurately accounting for the royalties of musicians. Previously, it was just a contractual obligation of the record companies, and the artists would have to sue if they thought they were getting cheated. How many musicians (who aren&#8217;t getting their full share of royalties!) can afford to sue a multibillion $$$ corp?

> &#8216;While I applaud the recent attempts by some of the record companies to address issues raised by artists &#8230; under the current structure, there is no disincentive for record companies to properly account for and pay royalties,&#8217; [Senator Kevin] Murray said. &#8216;Therefore, bad behavior by companies is rewarded. SB1034 simply makes it law that record companies must accurately report royalties to the artist.&#8217;
