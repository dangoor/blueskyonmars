I&#8217;ve been using the [Deer Park][1] alpha (Firefox 1.1 alpha) for a few days now. So far, it&#8217;s been very stable and very fast. It also includes a couple of regular annoyances with Firefox 1.0&#8230; those things that don&#8217;t really stop you from doing what you want, but annoy you every time you hit it (which is frequently).

1. When you open a link from an external program (like Mail), it now opens in a new tab rather than replacing the contents of your topmost browser window.
  
2. You can middle-click to open a link in a new tab, which something I do \*a lot\*. Opening a link in a new tab is part of my normal reading flow with Zesty News.

I&#8217;d highly recommend Deer Park for other Mac users. The only drawback I&#8217;ve seen is that some extensions have not yet been updated for Deer Park. Don&#8217;t worry, though&#8230; the Web Developer extension is there!
