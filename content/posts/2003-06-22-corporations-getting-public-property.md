Philip Greenspun writes that [the stock market is climbing because the government is giving away public property][1].

> Look around you at stuff that you believe to be public property. Very likely it will soon be given away to America&#8217;s largest corporations and consequently their stock will go up even if they don&#8217;t innovate.

This is only as likely as we make it. Never forget that we, as consumers and voters, hold the real power. If we (as consumers) put our feet down and purchase goods from companies we believe in, that will transfer significant power to those companies. And if we (as voters) put our feet down and don&#8217;t vote for politicians who disrespect the property that _we_ own, there will be change on Capitol Hill.

Those are big &#8220;ifs&#8221;, though.
