I fired up my handy [Cyberduck][1] and discovered, among the new version&#8217;s features, [Growl!][2]. Growl is a centralized notification system for Mac OS X, so that any app that needs to do popup notification can do so in a consistent way. Nice idea, and they provide bindings for several languages. (BSD-licensed as well, so go ahead and use it!)
