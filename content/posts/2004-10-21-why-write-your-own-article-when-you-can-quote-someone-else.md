Is it just me, or is it a bit lame that Sys-Con&#8217;s XML Journal [quoted most of Tim Bray&#8217;s article][1] rather than just linking to it? Apparently, they couldn&#8217;t get Tim to actually write for them. Ick. By the way, [NeoOffice/J is cool][2]. It is quite nice to be able to run OpenOffice without running X. XML Journal is free to quote the following from my blog:

> Sys-Con&#8217;s XML Journal is apparently out of ideas and in need of ad revenue, said Kevin Dangoor. Perhaps next time, they&#8217;ll consider creating their own content instead or at least using a &#8220;hyperlink&#8221;, which I hear will be popular any day now. Perhaps the article will even be something that&#8217;s actually about XML, rather than a Mac GUI on top an office suite.
