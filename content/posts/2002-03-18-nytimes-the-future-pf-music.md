NYTimes Magazine features an article describing [the future of music][1]. This author envisions a world in which you don&#8217;t pay for copies of music. We&#8217;ve got a long way to go before we get to the point where that idea is readily accepted (by professionals, the industry and Congress). By ordinary folk, the idea has certainly been accepted already.
