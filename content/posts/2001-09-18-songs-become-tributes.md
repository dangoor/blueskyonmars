onicnet has an article about [songs that have become tributes to the terrorist victims][1]. Songs performed by many artists including Moby, Whitney Houston, Jewel, Live and more have been picked up by stations. Some of the stations added quotes from Bush and others as well. As a show of support, Live has released an MP3 of their excellent track [Overcome][2] from their new album, _V_.
