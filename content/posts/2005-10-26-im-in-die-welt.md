No, Die Welt is not doing an expose on the seamy underbelly of TurboGears. (TurboGears doesn&#8217;t actually have an underbelly, let alone a seamy one).

Martin Dowideit wrote [an article about the US Postal Service][1] for [Die Welt][2] and found my blog posting about the [delivery of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince][3] from earlier in the year. It looks like I&#8217;m the &#8220;human interest&#8221; portion of the article which is a general overview of where the USPS stands and the challenges it faces.

For those actually in Germany and holding a copy of today&#8217;s Die Welt, you can find the article on page 16. Martin was kind enough to send a PDF of the page so I can see how it appears for those of you over there.
