What a great business idea! [RipDigital][1] will take your CDs in, rip them at high quality, and send you back MP3s on DVD-ROM or a hard drive. I remember how long it took to rip our collection of CDs a few years back. They&#8217;ve priced the service to make it a good deal relative to the amount of time a person would spend ripping. It&#8217;s a great business for them, though, because they only need to rip the songs once! Once they have the digital copies, they just have to make a DVD-ROM of the songs on the CDs you send them. If they _don&#8217;t_ do this, then it doesn&#8217;t seem like their service will be as insanely profitable.

One interesting aspect to their service (this must be their lawyers talking) is that they apparently watermark the files. Their Ts&Cs make it obvious that if the music industry comes after them, they&#8217;re just going to point the finger at you.
