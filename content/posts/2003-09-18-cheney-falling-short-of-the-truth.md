Via the [Democrats&#8217; Kicking Ass blog][1], I come across this [dissection of Cheney&#8217;s appearance on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221;][2]:

> In his appearance on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; Sunday, Cheney fell woefully short of truth. On the subject of Iraq, the same can be said for President Bush, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz. But Cheney is the latest example of administration mendacity, and therefore a good place to start in holding the administration accountable.
