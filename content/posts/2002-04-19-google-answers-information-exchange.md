Years ago, I thought that an information exchange would be a powerful tool. People ask questions, other people supply answers&#8230; Google now has a [beta of such a service][1] People state how much they&#8217;re willing to pay for answers to their questions, and the Researcher that answers gets 75% of the money. (Google takes $0.50 listing fee plus the other 25%). I&#8217;m really happy to see the Google folks taking novel, user-friendly approaches to generating revenue. No pop-up, gigantic Flash ads.
