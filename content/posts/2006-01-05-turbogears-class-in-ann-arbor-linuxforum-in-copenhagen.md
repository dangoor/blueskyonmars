Starting January 21st, Mark Ramm will be offering [a TurboGears class][1] for 20 people meeting every other Saturday in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Follow that link to read Mark&#8217;s thoughts about getting a learning experience built around TurboGears. These classes will also help Mark hone the content for the TurboGears book we&#8217;re working on.

CatWalk/ModelDesigner creator and all around good guy Ronald Jaramillo will be [presenting TurboGears at LinuxForum][2] in Copenhagen, Denmark. This is in March, so it&#8217;ll be a good forum for people wanting to learn about TurboGears 1.0.
