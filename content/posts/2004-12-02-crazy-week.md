My last week at JSTOR (now ended). Hard to say what I would have expected it to be&#8230; the part I certainly hadn&#8217;t anticipated was that all three of us were fighting a cold. Crysania woke up quite a bit last night, but I was still fairly concious at work today.

Now comes a few days of vacation and taking care of things around the house. I&#8217;m looking forward to diving in to the new business, but I&#8217;m also looking forward to diving in with many of these distractions out of the way.
