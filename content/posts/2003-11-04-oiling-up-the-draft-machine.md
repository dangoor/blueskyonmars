A scary article over at Salon: [Oiling up the draft machine?][1]:

> The Pentagon is quietly moving to fill draft board vacancies nationwide. While officials say there&#8217;s no cause to worry, some experts aren&#8217;t so sure.

There are signs that a draft may be necessary to rebuild Iraq. People wonder why such a big deal has been made over things that this administration has said to justify the invasion of Iraq&#8230; in addition to the 87 billion new reasons that have come up recently, now we&#8217;re talking about a situation that could get as ugly as Vietnam.
  
No one wants Saddam around, but think about how different this picture would be if we had gone into Iraq with the full support of the UN. We wouldn&#8217;t need to draft American troops because a truly multinational force would be working to keep the peace there. Now, we&#8217;re stuck with the situation there and have no choice but to pick up the pieces in Iraq.
