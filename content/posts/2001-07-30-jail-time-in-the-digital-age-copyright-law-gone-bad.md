Lawrence Lessig, one of the most active and visible people working to protect American citizen&#8217;s rights to content wrote this article: [Jail Time in the Digital Age][1]: _&#8220;Thus when the D.M.C.A. protects technology that in turn protects copyrighted material, it often protects much more broadly than copyright law does. It makes criminal what copyright law would forgive.&#8221;_ The article makes a very valid point about how the DMCA gives content makers more rights than they should be allowed.
