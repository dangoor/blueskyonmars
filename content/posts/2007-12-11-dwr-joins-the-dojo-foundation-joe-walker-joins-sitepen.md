Intriguingly, Ajaxian seems to have the news first: [Ajaxian Â» DWR joins the Dojo Foundation &#8211; Joe Walker joins SitePen][1]. I haven&#8217;t used Java in 3 years, so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to use DWR, but it looks like a nicely designed API for doing Ajax and Comet in Java apps. Having Joe Walker join up at SitePen is great news indeed, and DWR is quite an addition to the Dojo Foundation.

_Update:_ Ahh, that&#8217;s more like it. The word is officially out: [the SitePen press release][2], the [SitePen blog][3] (which has considerably more w00ts than the press release) and [Joe Walker][4] himself announcing it.
