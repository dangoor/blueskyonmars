The Eclipse project has announced [The Eclipse Visual Editor Projects][1], which will include extensible reference implementations for SWT _and_ Swing. Unfortunately, the download page for the builds lists Eclipse 2.1.2 as a requirement. Part of the trouble is that GEF doesn&#8217;t work under 3.0 yet. So, I _could_ go back to using 2.1. I don&#8217;t think I will, though. I like the new stuff in 3.0. I&#8217;ve gotten used to hitting ; in the middle of the line and having the ; appear at the end of the line (most of the time).
