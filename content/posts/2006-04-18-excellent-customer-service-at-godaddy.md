I just canceled my dedicated server at [GoDaddy][1], because they were stuck at Fedora Core 2, which makes any package upgrades and new installations a pain. Even though I canceled the hosting service, I&#8217;ve just got to say that they have excellent customer support. I&#8217;ve called them a few times over the past few months, and they&#8217;ve responded quickly and courteously, never gave me any kind of hassle when I wanted a refund for something, and have just been generally knowledgeable and ready to handle my requests. They even allow you to wait on hold silently rather than having to listen to some musical dreck. Especially given the prices they charge for their services, I think they do a very impressive job with customer support.
