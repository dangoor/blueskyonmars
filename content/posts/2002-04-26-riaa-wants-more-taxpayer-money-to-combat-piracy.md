C|Net has a story about [RIAA testimony in front of Congress][1], in which they ask for more money to be applied to catching pirates. From earlier writing of mine, you can see that I don&#8217;t think much of how the RIAA is handling their monopoly in the face of new technology. However, they do own the copyrights and the law should be upheld until it is changed. I would like to see an alternate music industry build up that is more consumer friendly. That is well within the law to do.
