Today, the [TurboGears googlegroup][1] passed the 1,000 members mark! I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the whole 10 fingers, 10 toes thing, but there&#8217;s something fun about these powers of 10 numbers. With 1,000 members, the group is roughly among the top 1% of all googlegroups in membership. Even better, it&#8217;s one of only 33 big groups that have &#8220;high&#8221; traffic. My estimate is that google delivered 1 million email messages for the group last month!
