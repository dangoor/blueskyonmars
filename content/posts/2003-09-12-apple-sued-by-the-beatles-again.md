[Back in May][1], I had figured that Apple Computer had worked out the legal issues in their deal with The Beatles&#8217; Apple Music. It turns out that I was wrong and [Apple has been sued by The Beatles over iPod, ITMS][2]

> &#8220;When it first happened with the iPod, we said, &#8220;What could they be thinking?&#8221; said a Beatles legal insider, who agreed that posters announcing the iPod from &#8220;AppleMusic&#8221; were among the most egregious violations. &#8220;They knew we had the agreement, and that we&#8217;d won a lot of money from them already.&#8221;
