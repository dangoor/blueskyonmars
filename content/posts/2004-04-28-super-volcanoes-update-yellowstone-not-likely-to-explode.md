An ever popular BSOM posting was about [Super Volcanoes][1], and the possibility of Yellowstone erupting and eradicating life as we know it. New research apparently concludes that [massive eruptions are rare, and Yellowstone does not appear to be gearing up for one][2]. So, you can officially quit worrying about super volcanoes and go back to worrying about [sudden climate change][3].
