It will be a miracle if the recording industry survives the PR fiasco they&#8217;re creating for themselves. The latest is that the RIAA filed a [lawsuit against a woman who was clearly not a file trader][1]:

> But [defendant Sarah] Ward, 66, is a &#8220;computer neophyte&#8221; who never installed file-sharing software, let alone downloaded hard-core rap about baggy jeans and gold teeth, according to letters sent to the recording industry&#8217;s agents by her lawyer, Jeffrey Beeler.
> 
> Other defendants have blamed their children for using file-sharing software, but Ward has no children living with her, Beeler said.
> 
> Moreover, Ward uses a Macintosh computer at home. Kazaa runs only on Windows-based personal computers.
