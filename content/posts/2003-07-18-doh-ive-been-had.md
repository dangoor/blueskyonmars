Thank you, snopes! According to the new [Urban Legends Reference Pages: Inboxer Rebellion (Metallica)][1] article, [yesterday&#8217;s story about Metallica suing over the E, F chords][2] is false. I should know enough to look at the URL and realize that the article yesterday was _not_ actually MTV.com.
