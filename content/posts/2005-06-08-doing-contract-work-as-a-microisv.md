Ian Landsman says not to [be afraid of contract work][1] when you&#8217;re starting your microISV. He makes some great points. The key point, I think, is cashflow. In order for the business to survive, at some point cash needs to come in. Having ready access to more cash, like consulting gigs, is a good way to keep things going.

I&#8217;ve made some choices recently that are delaying Zesty News a bit, but will result in a stronger product in the end. I haven&#8217;t taken any consulting jobs yet, but cashflow is definitely on my mind and I&#8217;m thinking of my options now. I know I have the resources to get Zesty News out the door, but I want to have the resources to keep it going as well!

Be sure to check out Ian&#8217;s guidelines for taking consulting work. They&#8217;re good tips!
