I have a fairly small blogroll, because I don&#8217;t look at that many sites frequently. However, I think I&#8217;ve been missing out by not following [Erik&#8217;s Weblog][1]. JavaBlogs has been good, but Erik provides a bit more &#8220;concentrated&#8221; output. There&#8217;s a bit less spiralling, a bit less bile, and a bit less debate over who&#8217;s blogging anonymously. Everything you want in a tech blog ðŸ™‚
