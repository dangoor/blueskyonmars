Calling an &#8220;alpha&#8221; feature complete is kind of funny. In my book, an &#8220;alpha&#8221; release is one that is missing some features that are planned for the final release. A &#8220;beta&#8221; release has all of the planned features, but is not fully tested.

At this point, I have put together all of the features planned for Zesty News 1.0 alpha. So, the alpha is feature complete&#8230; but Zesty News 1.0 final is not.

Last week, I put on my product manager hat and decided that I would let me do a little feature creep. I added automatic update detection and the ability for the user to download and install a patch file for most updates. I have not yet done size optimization on the Zesty News releases, so the builds are pretty large. While going through the testing cycle, I&#8217;d really rather not force people to re-download a few megs when a couple hundred K will suffice. Beyond the download size, though, this update system lets the user know what is new and lets them download and install with a single click. That&#8217;s a lot more convenient than downloading and running the installer.

Thus starts cleanup work: fixing known issues and niggles and making the interface look better.
