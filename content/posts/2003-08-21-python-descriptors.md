Raymond Hettinger has written a [How-To Guide for Descriptors][1] which is a very good intro to the topic. I thought Python&#8217;s new staticmethod and property syntaxes were rather odd compared to Java&#8217;s way of doing it, but reading about the general purpose Descriptor mechanism makes it clearer. Looks like a very useful language feature indeed.
