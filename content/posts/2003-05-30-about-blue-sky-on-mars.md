## History

This site was originally called We Write Online (at http://www.wewriteonline.org/blog) when I created it in June, 2001. There is actually more of a story about what We Write Online was going to be, and I&#8217;ll write about that sometime. All it ever actually became was my blog.

For 2001, I was running Thatware and wrote a fair bit about technology and other stuff that interested me. In 2002, I switched to Drupal as my weblog program. The topics didn&#8217;t change much, but the amount of writing decreased dramatically, largely due to the very busy job I had. In 2003, I&#8217;ve switched blog programs again&#8230; this time to MovableType. I&#8217;ve also changed the name to Blue Sky On Mars.

## So what is it?

It&#8217;s my weblog, and that&#8217;s it. Nothing more or less pretentious than that.

This blog is here as a place for me to gather my thoughts on things that may interest me, and provide me with an easily accessible memory that is sometimes more reliable than the one I&#8217;ve got between my ears. I&#8217;ve made it public, because I do like hearing other people&#8217;s comments and sharing these thoughts that I&#8217;ve written down. But, even if I&#8217;m the only reader, this site will continue to exist.

## What&#8217;s with that name?

It&#8217;s a phrase from [Total Recall][1], and I like it. It evokes an image of people flying to Mars, possibly hanging out with the Martians (who ideally look like the [Sea Monkeys][2] pictured on the packages), and having a good, old fashioned barbecue. I&#8217;m not sure what we&#8217;d be barbecuing, because it doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s much on Mars other than rocks, but that&#8217;s beside the point.
