Though you&#8217;ll see from the website that it is geared toward children, [Inspiration][1] is reported by some to be a great tool for anyone who likes to think visually and organize their thoughts with outlines. I haven&#8217;t tried it, so I can&#8217;t personally recommend it. I wanted to keep a link here, though, because it sounds intriguing.
