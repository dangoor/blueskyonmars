Jonathan LaCour has sent up the call: [Fast Track Needs You!][1] And it does! A chance to help out with a new name, logo and look. It&#8217;s a great and useful project, and these are fun areas to help in. (Oh, and I&#8217;m certain Jonathan would be happy to accept patches if you want to help out in that way ðŸ™‚
