Interesting announcement from Google: [Official Google Blog: Encouraging people to contribute knowledge][1]

Google announces a tool (Knol) that&#8217;s not yet open to the public but appears to be taking on Wikipedia. The premise is different, but I think the goal is similar. They want encyclopedia like articles that are written by people in the community who know stuff about a topic. However, Google&#8217;s take appears to be to have articles that are authored by single people that will stake their own personal reputations on the articles. Though Wikipedia articles have a history, they don&#8217;t have a by-line. Knol articles do.

The likely scenario here is not that Knol will overtake Wikipedia, of course. The reality is that we&#8217;ll just have both. Seriously, Wikipedia has a ton of articles (more than 1 million in English, if I remember correctly). I don&#8217;t think that Knol, as described, will compete in sheer breadth. But, it is possible that the quality of articles that get prominent placement may be high. We&#8217;ll see when they release it.
