I&#8217;m pretty sure that [Mac Mini: The Emperor&#8217;s New Computer][1], a review of Apple&#8217;s new machine, is a joke. Or, rather, I&#8217;m positive it&#8217;s a joke, but I think it is an intentional one. Check out these howlers:

> While the hardware is about roughly equivalent to a Windows PC circa 1995, what got me interested were Apple’s claims about its size, weight and footprint.

I recently retired my 1995 machine which had been doing Linux fileserving duties most recently. It was a Pentium 133 with 32MB of RAM. At this point, I thought the guy was just exaggerating. With the next sentence, I thought the guy wasn&#8217;t paying attention.

> If you believe Apple’s marketing department, the new Mini is “smaller than most packs of gum” and weighs “less than four quarters”.

Having watched the MacWorld keynote, I recognized this as the description of the iPod Shuffle, not the Mac mini. To be sure, there&#8217;s a big difference in size between _those_ two. The complaints that followed about the lack of serial ports, parallel ports and floppy drives started me down the track of thinking this article was out for laughs. I knew it for sure, though, here:

> This is where the first noticeable problem with Apple design arises. While there is a Mac-style “donnnnggggg” when the Mini is first turned on, during normal operation the unit makes no sound whatsoever. This could make it very difficult for a novice user to know whether or not the computer is on.

Now that I was finally in on the joke, the article just gets funnier.

> For example, there is no Outlook Express for email, but Apple includes a program called Mail, which is like a stripped-down email client that can’t execute scripts or open attachments without user intervention.

Gotta love that conclusion:

> So is the mini a maxi value? For me, clearly, no. When I consider that a good deal of my time is spent running applications like Disk Defragmenter, Scandisk, Norton AV, Windows Update and Ad-Aware&#8211;none of which are available for the Mac platform&#8211;it doesn&#8217;t make sense for me to &#8220;switch&#8221; to a Mac at this time.

This review is actually a dig at Windows in the guise of a bad review of the Mac Mini! Good job! I wish I had thought of that.
  
I came to [DivisionTwo][2] by a direct link to the article above. Going in by the front page, you can see that they&#8217;re all about funny fake geek stories. I hadn&#8217;t been aware of that, which made the article that much more entertaining. But, now the surprise is ruined, alas&#8230;
