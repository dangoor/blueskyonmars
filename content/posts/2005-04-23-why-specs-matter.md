Being an XP type, I don&#8217;t go in for specs for everything. Where interoperability counts, specs are key&#8230; and Mark Pilgrim nails the personalities in [Why specs matter][1].

> “Angels” read specs closely, write code, and then thoroughly test it against the accompanying test suite before shipping their product. Angels do not actually exist, but they are a useful fiction to make spec writers to feel better about themselves.
