Joel Spolsky talks about software product pricing in [Camels and Rubber Duckies][1]. As always, Joel gives an entertaining and worthwhile read. I&#8217;ll give you the spoiler now, though: Joel&#8217;s not going to give you the answer. The answer is complicated, and Joel does give you some points to think about in pricing your product. On Joel&#8217;s recommendation in his forums, I&#8217;m reading _The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing_ which really gets into the nitty gritty of the things to consider when pricing your product. Pricing is an exceedingly important part of your overall strategy if you&#8217;re building your own software product. You&#8217;ll ultimately have to guess, but it should at least be a somewhat informed guess&#8230;
