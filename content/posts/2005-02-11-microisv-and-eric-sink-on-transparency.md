Today, I happened across [MicroISV][1], which is a blog for tiny independent software developers. Hey! That&#8217;s me! And, by golly, the articles posted there look mighty interesting. One example was a link to Eric Sink&#8217;s latest: [Tenets of Transparency][2]. Eric is a sharp guy who writes well and raises good points. This article advocates trusting your customers and taking care of them to improve your business.

It&#8217;s cool to note that, as part of writing the article, he ended up changing SourceGear&#8217;s refund policy! Putting his money where his mouth is indeed.

Update: I just thought I would point out that [Ian Landsman&#8217;s blog][3] is indeed a good example of a business working transparently.
