The Sacramento Bee has an article about [musicians raising money to battle the record companies][1]. Some big names are set to perform: Elton John, No Doubt, The Eagles, Sheryl Crow, Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks. Dexter Holland of The Offspring said &#8220;It&#8217;s about time for artists to take control of their work and how it is presented to our fans&#8221;. Very good.

From something reported earlier, artists shouldn&#8217;t necessarily expect royalties because they get their money up front in the form of advances. But, if I were a major label artist, I would not want my work to be sold on copy protected CDs or pitched through some ridiculous online service that doesn&#8217;t let people enjoy the music as much as they could.
