Brian Beck is starting work on a project named [Merquery][1], with the goal of making full text indexing (aka &#8220;a search engine&#8221;) trivial for users of rapid development frameworks like TurboGears. Reading the post that I&#8217;m linking to, it doesn&#8217;t sound like Brian is reinventing the search engine wheel. Making a high-quality engine is hard work and has been done by a number of projects already. Brian is talking about providing a drop dead simple API for getting the engine running with your database. That&#8217;s a great goal, and many projects (Docudo, TurboBlog, Fast Track come to mind) could benefit greatly.
