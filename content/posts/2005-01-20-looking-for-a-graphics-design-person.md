I&#8217;m not a graphics person. There, I&#8217;ve said it. I can admit it to the whole world (of course, you already knew that, judging by Blue Sky On Mars :). I&#8217;m looking for someone to work with (on a contract basis) on the product I&#8217;m building and its associated website. I&#8217;m not particular about finding someone who has a lot of fancy resume experience. I&#8217;m looking for someone who has a good style and knowledge of putting together nice looking web pages.

Someone in Ann Arbor would be fabulous. Someone halfway around the world would be fine as well, though.

Please send me email if you or someone you know might be interested. Thanks!
