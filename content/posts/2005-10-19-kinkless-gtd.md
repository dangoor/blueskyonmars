Because I&#8217;m behind on my reading, I hadn&#8217;t heard about the [Kinkless GTD system for OmniOutliner][1]. I had already been organizing myself via OmniOutliner, but Kinkless looks much slicker than the route I was taking. If you&#8217;re into GTD and OmniOutliner, this is something you should really see!
