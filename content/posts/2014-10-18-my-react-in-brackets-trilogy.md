I started experimenting with [React][1] in February or March, blogged about my experiments starting in May, committed to landing a Brackets feature in September and the latest release of Brackets now ships with React. Here are my three posts on the subject, in reverse chronological order:

  * [The New React-based Brackets Project Tree][2]
  * [React in Brackets?][3]
  * [Simplifying Code with React][4]

I will likely be talking more about simplifying code soon, especially given [my 1DevDay Detroit talk][5] coming up next month.
