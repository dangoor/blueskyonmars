<a title="XUL Apps > Tabbrowser Extensions &#8211; outsider reflex&#8221; href=&#8221;http://white.sakura.ne.jp/~piro/xul/_tabextensions.html.en&#8221;>Tabbrowser Extensions</a> provides a slew of new features for people who like tabbed browsing in Mozilla. I was thinking that Type Ahead Find was the only thing keeping me from switching to Safari on my Mac, but this extension offers so many cool things that it may just keep me stuck to Moz.
