Rapid Web Applications With TurboGears is now shipping from Amazon, and I just looked and found it at #20 on [Amazon.com&#8217;s Computers/Internet Bestsellers][1]. Groovy! Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s buying it!

Update: Since this was a transient event, I wanted to get a screenshot (which I didn&#8217;t have time to do earlier when I first posted this). We were 21 when I first posted this but, as you can see above, we landed at #20.
