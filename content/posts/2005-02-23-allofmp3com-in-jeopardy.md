[MP3s for pennies? Russian cops say no | CNET News.com][1] Though AllOfMP3.com has insisted that their licenses are valid based on the laws in Russia, apparently the police are investigating them for copyright infringement. (Found via [Engadget][2].

I&#8217;ll reiterate what others have said: the big deal about AllOfMP3 is _not_ the price. The big deal is that you can choose your file format, and get files that you know you can use now and forever. I&#8217;d still be an AllOfMP3 shopper at the iTMS price of $0.99 per song.
