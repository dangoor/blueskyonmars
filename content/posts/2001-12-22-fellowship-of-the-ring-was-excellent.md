We saw Fellowship of the Ring on Thursday night. One warning: a 10:15 showing finished up at 1:30, so be prepared. I&#8217;ll leave my commentary on it short, simple and spoiler free: it was an excellent movie. If you&#8217;re at all into fantasy, this is as good as it gets. Expect nominations for Best Picture and Best Director Oscars (in addition to the expected Best Visual Effects).
