For those people who read my blog and happen to live around Ann Arbor, there are two free electronic waste recycling opportunities coming up.

  * Tomorrow (April 28, 2008) from 10am to 4pm at the Best Buy on Lohr Road
  * Saturday May 10 from 9am to 2pm at Pioneer High School

Keep that mercury, lead and other nasty stuff out of our landfills by taking your electronic junk to one of these places. It&#8217;s finally time to get rid of that 14&#8243; CRT and the 486.
