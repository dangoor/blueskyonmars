Yahoo! has just released a [Design Pattern Library][1] which provides some very good guidelines for using fancy web controls, and they&#8217;ve also released their own JavaScript library: [Yahoo! UI Library][2]. The Yahoo! UI Library has a number of the same sorts of features that you&#8217;d get from [MochiKit][3] or [Dojo][4]. It&#8217;s also well-documented, which is a bonus. It doesn&#8217;t have the &#8220;pythonic&#8221; set of functions that MochiKit offers or the overwhelming completeness of Dojo, but it looks like a respectable entrant in the JavaScript library space. It also carries a BSD license, so it can be freely used for anything!
