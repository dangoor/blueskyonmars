The server that runs turbogears.org has sporadically had a problem where the Apache process completely bogs down (and the load average gets up around 20). I haven&#8217;t had the time to really chase it down and it happened randomly enough that I didn&#8217;t worry too much about it.

Over the past few days, however, the site has been down more than it&#8217;s been up! So, on New Years Day, I finally took Remi Delon up on his offer of free hosting for turbogears.org at [WebFaction][1]. In order to get things back online, I somewhat hastily moved the services over. But, it all went smoothly. WebFaction&#8217;s control panel made setting things up a snap. And for a couple of the more esoteric things I needed to do, Remi was a big help.

www.turbogears.org, trac.turbogears.org, files.turbogears.org and svn.turbogears.org are all being served from WebFaction now.

A big thank you to Remi Delon and his WebFaction partners!

Note: Blue Sky On Mars is still running on the problematic server. I hope to be completely moved to another server soon.
