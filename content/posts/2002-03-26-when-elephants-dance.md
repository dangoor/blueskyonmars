I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t point to this [excellent essay by Michael Fraase][1]. He does one of the best jobs I&#8217;ve seen of providing an up-to-the-minute recount of where digital rights currently stands. He also mentions the new [DigitalConsumer.org][2] which has a very similar set of rules to something I&#8217;m involved in.
