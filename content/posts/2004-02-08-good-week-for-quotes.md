Here&#8217;s a dandy article about how hard it is [to gain access to public records in Florida][1], despite the Constitution guaranteeing that access. The amusing quote regards one county superintendent who refused to turn over his cell phone bill:

> &#8220;He could have been a terrorist,&#8221; Howard said. &#8220;We have to ensure the safety of children.&#8221;
> 
> Howard couldn&#8217;t explain how a terrorist might use his cell phone bill to harm children.

The second great quote of the week is brought to you courtesy of MTV:

> &#8220;There&#8217;s now going to be an FCC investigation into the nipple,&#8221; MTV Chief Executive Tom Freston confirms after it was revealed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) would look into whether the incident broke FCC rules regarding indecency or obscenity.

&#8220;Investigation into the nipple&#8221; had probably never been uttered before&#8230; and now, it&#8217;s got 35 matches on Google! I&#8217;d ask &#8220;who says stuff like that?&#8221;, but apparently the answer is the CEO of MTV!
  
Update&#8230; how could I forget this one:

> 54. At this point in time, IBM&#8217;s UNIX expertise was centered on its own Power PC processor. IBM had little or no expertise on Intel processors.

Yes, here&#8217;s SCO revising their [complaint against IBM][2] and claiming that IBM has no expertise on Intel processors. Sure, they&#8217;re trying to narrow it down to UNIX expertise, but what does that matter? IBM invented the PC and wrote a goodly portion of OS/2, so they definitely had a lot of in-house experience with Intel processors. Those wild and wacky SCO guys. Next thing you know, they&#8217;ll be claiming that Sun has little to no experience with the Java language.
