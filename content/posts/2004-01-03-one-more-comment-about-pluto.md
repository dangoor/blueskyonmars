Not everyone has the oodles of time it would take to set up a system that does what Pluto does. The current Wired has a picture of a house that a guy spent $2.5 million outfitting with goodies. I bet some portion of that went to consultants that installed and configured everything. That&#8217;s Pluto&#8217;s business&#8230; making this accessible for people without years to burn on this stuff.
