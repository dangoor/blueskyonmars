I&#8217;ll be speaking at [CodeMash][1] for the second year in a row. At CodeMash &#8217;07, I did an introduction to TurboGears.

At CodeMash &#8217;08, I&#8217;ll be doing an overview of the [Dojo JavaScript toolkit][2]. Dojo is a comprehensive and powerful package, so I&#8217;m going to do what I can to highlight nifty things the package can do. I&#8217;m going to work under the assumption that people who attend this talk understand JavaScript, but that&#8217;s really the only pre-req.

CodeMash &#8217;07 was a remarkably well run conference, given that this was the first year. It&#8217;s a great conference to show off technology like Dojo, because there is a very diverse audience. (That&#8217;s the whole point after all: bring people from different areas together&#8230; .NET, Java, Python, Ruby and JavaScript all in one conference!)
