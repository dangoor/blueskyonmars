[JSConf][1] is coming up on Friday, and I&#8217;ll be there. I was too late to get a normal &#8220;track A&#8221; talk in, but I am scheduled in the &#8220;track B&#8221; room for Saturday at 1:45PM to talk about a standard library for JavaScript development outside of the browser. It&#8217;ll be a 30 minute session, and I&#8217;m hoping to have some cool stuff to show!

I hope to see you there!
