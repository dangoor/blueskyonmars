I don&#8217;t have any statistics to share on this, but something that has just occurred to me is that there have been several instances over the past couple of weeks where people have mentioned that they&#8217;re new to Python while they&#8217;re asking questions about TurboGears.

Python has been my language of choice for a decade, and I&#8217;m happy to be contributing in some way to growing Python&#8217;s usage.
