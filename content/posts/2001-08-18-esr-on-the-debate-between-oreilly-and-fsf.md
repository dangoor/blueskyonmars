Apparently, Tim O&#8217;Reilly and two notables from the FSF (Kuhn and Stallman) have been debating the issue of &#8220;software freedom&#8221;. The FSF has the stated belief that software freedom means that they have a right to have the source code to software and to give copies of that software to people they wish. O&#8217;Reilly believes that a software developer is free to release software under whatever license makes sense for them.

[Eric Raymond responds][1] essentially agreeing with O&#8217;Reilly. I&#8217;m very much in agreement with ESR&#8217;s argument here: as long as people don&#8217;t interfere with my flerbage, I&#8217;m fine with what they do.
