Apparently, it&#8217;s Mac software bundle time again. MacHeist has &#8220;retail bundle&#8221; deal going that is entirely uninteresting to me. I first read about it a few days ago, and it&#8217;s since only sold 980 bundles&#8230; far less than has been typical for one of their deals.

MacUpdate has just released a new bundle that is far more interesting. The [Parallels Bundle][1]. They&#8217;re being a bit sneaky calling it that, because Parallels is the last app that will be unlocked. They don&#8217;t even tell you how many they have to sell before Parallels is unlocked. The bundle costs $65. For people that don&#8217;t own Parallels, this could be a steal because Parallels itself retails for $80.

Even so, the collection of apps that you <span style="font-style: italic;">know</span> you will get is pretty decent as it is. I&#8217;ve always thought Leap looked interesting, and that&#8217;s $59 regularly. Typinator is a useful sort of tool once you get using it. I don&#8217;t have time to write a novel right now, but if I did StoryMill looks like a fun way to do it. Art Text looks useful for presentations and such. The other apps I could do without, personally. DVDRemaster <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> be nice, but is it really better than Handbrake?

I buy my fair share (at least!) of indie Mac software, and bundles like this are a good way to try out and really get into a bunch of new tools. (And, yes, that is an affiliate link up there. I wouldn&#8217;t be posting this if it wasn&#8217;t interesting, though. After all, the MacHeist bundle has been up for days and I wouldn&#8217;t have even mentioned that one if it weren&#8217;t for the more interesting MacUpdate bundle appearing.)
