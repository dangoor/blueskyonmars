Last night, we saw [Amelie][1]. It was a great movie! Excellent writing, characters, direction&#8230; There&#8217;s a reason that it&#8217;s #21 on the IMDB Top 250. Two other movies that I saw over the past few weeks that were excellent: [Monsters, Inc.][2] and [Harry Potter][3] (both of which are in the IMDB 250 as well).

Also a worthy piece of entertainment: [Ocean&#8217;s 11][4], which was fun and nicely put together. If you&#8217;re looking for a similar kind of movie that is more serious, check out [The Score][5]. It would be great if movies of the caliber of these films always came out.
