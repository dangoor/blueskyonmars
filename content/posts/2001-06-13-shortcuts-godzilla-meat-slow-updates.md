The &#8220;Shortcuts&#8221; topic will be for multiple quick things that come up over a day or two. I could&#8217;ve called them &#8220;Quickies&#8221;, but then this site would be just a little too much like [Slashdot][1] without the discussions.
  
CNN brings us a fun little article about a [Japanese company offering Godzilla meat][2]. It&#8217;s really corned beef, but who&#8217;ll know? It probably should have been something that &#8220;tastes like chicken&#8221;.

By the way, over the next few weeks, I&#8217;ve got family visiting on and off&#8230; so this will not be the most frequently updated weblog in the world.
