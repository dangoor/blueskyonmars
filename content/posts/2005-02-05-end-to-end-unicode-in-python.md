[End to End Unicode Web Applications in Python][1] by Martin Doudoroff probably would have been very helpful to me a few days ago, but I only just now stumbled across it. I&#8217;ve already achieved unicode enlightenment, but if you find yourself struggling with it, this doc looks like a good place to start!
