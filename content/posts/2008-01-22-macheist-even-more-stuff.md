[MacHeist][1] has caught some flak in the past for selling indie Mac developer wares at a price that&#8217;s too low (by some reckonings, see below). On the other hand, those developers are choosing to become part of the promotion <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> MacHeist raises money for charity. This go around, they&#8217;ve raised more than $320,000.

I bought the heist primarily for PixelMator and 1password, though I&#8217;ve also found that I enjoy CoverSutra. There are a lot of other apps in the $49 bundle that make it a good deal for many (Snapz Pro X!)

**Update**: I can&#8217;t believe I missed noticing this. The bundle now includes Vector Designer as well. That means that you get a vector drawing program (imagine Adobe Illustrator Lite) and a bitmap editor (Adobe Photoshop Lite). Plus everything else in the bundle. It really is a great deal for the buyer.

I&#8217;m mentioning the heist again here on my blog because they&#8217;ve opened up more apps <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> they&#8217;ve added a referral program that delivers even more cool software. So, if you&#8217;re thinking of buying the heist, time is running out&#8230; and please [use my link][1].

**Update (1/23/08)**: Thanks to everyone who bought the Heist through my link. I did indeed get a copy of NoteBook. I hope you enjoy the software bundle! It&#8217;s working out nicely for me so far.

## Would <span style="font-style: italic;">I</span> be a part of the Heist?

With all of that said, I think it is an interesting question: would I want software I create to be a part of something like MacHeist?

During the first Heist, Gus Mueller [broke down the numbers][2] and decided it wasn&#8217;t a good deal. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s so clear cut.

First of all, I think it&#8217;s better to focus business decisions on absolute measures rather than relative measures. Consider stock market investing. Many mutual funds will compare themselves to the S&P 500 (if they&#8217;re lucky enough to be beating it). Let&#8217;s say that they beat the S&P 500 by 1% over the past 3 months. That&#8217;s pretty darn good performance. Except for the fact that you just lost 10% (for the past 3 months, the S&P 500 is down 11.69%).

Yes, I know that you can&#8217;t time the market and all of that. My point is that by relative measures that mutual fund was a winner. Absolutely, though, it was a dog. You could&#8217;ve just left your money in a mattress.

So, for a second let&#8217;s remove the relative earnings of the MacHeist guys from the equation.

Users cost money in terms of support, but have the potential to bring in word-of-mouth (or word-of-blog) advertising. A micro ISV could get absolutely swamped by a sudden influx of thousands of new users, unless their product was absolutely rock solid, super easy to use and/or had a good, active set of forums to which people could turn for support.

The reason to go for a MacHeist would be the advertising you get from the heist itself, word-of-mouth from people who buy the heist, and upgrade revenue later on. All of that comes at a cost of lower (tiny, even) initial sale revenue and a likely deluge of support work.

If I was just getting a cool, but little known product off the ground (PixelMator?), it may very well be worthwhile. If I had a major upgrade coming in a few months (Notebook?), then I might be a participant. Acquiring users for the sake of having users is a bad goal. But, getting a product off the ground or building up a reasonable expectation of upgrade revenue is a good goal.

As for the MacHeist share of the pie: I&#8217;d focus first on whether my needs in the deal are getting met. Once that&#8217;s true, then I&#8217;d try to push for what I think is a fair balance between my share and that of MacHeist. But, that is definitely a secondary concern. If MacHeist is providing the best avenue for meeting my business needs, it&#8217;s worth the cost. Companies pay $1 million+ for a 30 second spot during the Super Bowl, because they feel that it fits their business needs. The same goes for a marketing opportunity like MacHeist.

That was the long answer. The short answer to whether I would participate in such a promotion is likely &#8220;no&#8221;, because the cost is too great. Only under the fairly limited set of circumstances above (new unknown product or coming upgrades) would I consider it.
