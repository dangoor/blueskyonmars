It&#8217;s been two weeks since my last blog entry. Why? I&#8217;ve been working like crazy. Generally, I&#8217;m not a fan of that. But, we&#8217;re finishing up a major project at work, and starting to transition to Extreme Programming (XP). I&#8217;m really excited about the changes we&#8217;re making, and I think our customers will be well-served by what we&#8217;re doing. XP seems like a great way to develop software, because it seems that you&#8217;re almost guaranteed to succeed if you follow it.
