I&#8217;ve been reading [43 Folders][1] for a while, and I really dig the whole GTD thing. Until today, I was keeping my next action lists in TextMate. But then I read Keith Robinson&#8217;s [How I learned to stop worrying and love my schedule][2] and it&#8217;s companion [How I Schedule Actions and Tasks][3].

Spreadsheets are a great generic tool for keeping track of lists of things, adding stuff up and the like. (I hear there are some potential applications in financial fields as well, but I&#8217;ll believe it when I see it.) I&#8217;ve been looking for a decent Mac OS X native spreadsheet for a while, and just couldn&#8217;t come up with anything short of splurging on Microsoft Office.

Keith&#8217;s post highlights a workflow where tasks are kept in [OmniOutliner][4] and then scheduled in iCal. What Keith&#8217;s posting showed me was that you can have columns in OmniOutliner, and those columns can be tallied. It&#8217;s like a hierarchical spreadsheet. I&#8217;ve only just gotten started with it, but it&#8217;s a beautiful package. 

When reading the articles, even though I loved what i saw about OmniOutliner, I could see a problem that I would have with the iCal part of the workflow. Keith alludes to it as well: it&#8217;s hard to rearrange big blobs of scheduled stuff if something comes up and forces its way into the middle of your schedule.

My thought: OmniOutliner to the rescue! I put estimates on my tasks the same way that Keith does. Then I create a &#8220;Schedule&#8221; outline with a top-level entry for each day and drag tasks from my various todo outlines onto each day. Most tasks don&#8217;t have to be done at a specific time of the day, so this works well. Just drop the tasks on the day and make sure the total of the tasks doesn&#8217;t go over the total time available in the day.

Outliners are naturally very good at selecting many nodes and moving them around to appropriate places. If something squeezes into my schedule, I just use this natural facility of the outliner to move things from one day to the next.

The only thing left is to figure out how to make appointments that _do_ have a fixed time make it into iCal, which does alarms and all that good stuff. Maybe it&#8217;s not such a big deal, if I&#8217;m always just working off of the outline.

OmniGroup managed to get a bit of extra money out of me today, because OmniOutliner met these organization needs I had and it just happens that I have some diagrams that need making, so the bundle with OmniGraffle, etc. turned out to be a good deal. This is particularly true given that OmniGraffle is about to have a price increase.
