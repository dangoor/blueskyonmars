A month after suing IBM, claiming that IBM&#8217;s Linux offerings infringe on intellectual property rights of SCO, <a title="Internet Week > Linux > SCO Threatens To Sue All Commercial Linux Users (UPDATED) > May 14, 2003&#8243; href=&#8221;http://www.internetweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=9901350&#8243;>SCO seems to be on the verge of suing more commercial Linux users.</a> And check out this choice quote:

> &#8220;Similar to analogous efforts underway in the music industry, we are prepared to take all actions necessary to stop the ongoing violation of our intellectual property or other rights.&#8221; 

Err, yeah. Those music industry efforts have proven to be _ever so successful_ and are a model for how to treat your customers and prospective customers. Bruce Perens is confident that Linux is in the clear, and says that SCO&#8217;s own Linux offering may possibly run afoul of the GPL.
  
It will be interesting to see what happens in this case, given that IBM is large enough to crush SCO if they choose.
