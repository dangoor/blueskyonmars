Yesterday&#8217;s terrorist attacks were a huge atrocity. My heartfelt condolences to everyone who lost a loved one, and my wishes for a speedy recovery to everyone who was injured. I pray that US retaliation is done with proper forethought to ensure that the correct perpetrators are identified.
  
[Dave Winer][1] provided good coverage of the events, with a variety of views.

That&#8217;s one of the things I like about Dave&#8217;s site. You hear voices you don&#8217;t hear when you turn on CNN.
