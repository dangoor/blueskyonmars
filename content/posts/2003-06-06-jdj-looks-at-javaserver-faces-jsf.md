Java Developer&#8217;s Journal has a new [article][1] about [JavaServer Faces][2]. In short:

> In this article, we will survey the various Java Web development frameworks that are popular today and then take an in-depth look into the JavaServer Faces (JSF) technology.

The &#8220;survey of frameworks&#8221; didn&#8217;t say a whole lot and doesn&#8217;t draw comparisons between JSF and the open source frameworks. But the article was a good intro to JSF for the uninitiated, like myself.
  
When it comes to frameworks that we base applications on, I&#8217;m very wary if the source is not available. The source may be available for JSF as part of the Java Web Services Developer Pack, but I did notice that the license does not allow redistribution of the JSF package. So, don&#8217;t go trying to sell a JSF app!
  
It appears that you can (or will be able to) use [Struts with JSF][3], if you like.
