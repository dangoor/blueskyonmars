Bruce Eckel is proposing [Some Kind of Event][1] in place of his Thinking in Java event. He&#8217;s considering doing something in TurboGears (possibly a Rails/TurboGears comparison, or developing a TG app, or porting one from Python to Java). This would be a great event! I really wish I could attend, but my schedule&#8217;s just not open at that point. Please pester Bruce if you&#8217;d like to see TurboGears highlighted at his event.

Forgot the link to [Mark Ramm,][2] the original source where I heard about this.
