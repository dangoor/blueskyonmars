[WebFaction][1], in addition to having the easiest TurboGears hosting, is now good for the project in another way: they are paying 50% of their profits from TurboGears hosting back to the project. That is money that I use to get services that benefit TurboGears itself.

Not sure who WebFaction is? WebFaction was formerly Python-Hosting.com. These guys know how to host TurboGears apps. After all, two of the principal folks from CherryPy are there!

A big thanks to Remi and co. at WebFaction!
