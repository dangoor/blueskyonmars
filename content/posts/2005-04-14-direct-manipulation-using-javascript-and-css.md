The [Ajaxian Blog][1] had a link to [Direct Manipulation Using JavaScript and CSS][2], a bunch of fabulous examples of drag and drop and in-place editing, all in the web browser. I was using Firefox, not IE, and there are warnings about IE problems. Who needs IE support, anyway? It&#8217;s only about 90% of the browser population, after all.

These are very nice examples, and something to consider striving for as you&#8217;re building an app.
