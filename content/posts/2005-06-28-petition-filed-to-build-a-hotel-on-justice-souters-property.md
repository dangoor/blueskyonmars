Apparently, a real request has been filed to [build Hotel Lost Liberty][1] on the current site of Supreme Court Justice Souter&#8217;s house. That is a very appropriate way to protest the eminent domain ruling, and I&#8217;m quite certain that Hotel Lost Liberty and the Just Desserts Cafe will definitely provide better revenues to the city. Via [Boing Boing][2].
