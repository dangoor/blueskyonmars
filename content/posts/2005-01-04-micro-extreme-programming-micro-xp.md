I had planned to write an article about using extreme programming (XP) within very small (1-3 person) teams. Luckily, I did a Google search first, and came up with
  
[micro-eXtreme Programming ( µ XP): Embedding XP Within Standard Projects][1] ([PDF][2]) by Frank Adrian of Symantec, so now I don&#8217;t have to.

Frank comes from the perspective that XP is good, but you can do a form of XP as an individual, even if the rest of your team is not doing it. The style that I&#8217;ve chosen to do is to work on 1 week iterations and standard XP-length stories, rather than Frank&#8217;s suggested &#8220;paragraphs&#8221;.

That&#8217;s the nice thing about development processes. You can always tailor them to your own specific needs.
