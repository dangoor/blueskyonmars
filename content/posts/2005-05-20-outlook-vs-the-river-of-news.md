[Dare Obasanjo][1] and [Dave Winer][2] are both talking about the problem with Outlook-style (3-pane) aggregators. I believe that Dave is generally right about the [River of News][3]: clicking on each feed and then clicking on each item is a drag. Thankfully, most aggregators seem to have moved past this. Even the built-in aggregator in Safari lets you view all of your feeds together.

And yet, even though the aggregators offer other views that are more River of News-like, that&#8217;s not the default view. Imagine for a moment a newspaper that had a front page like this:

> ## The Daily Press Gazette Morning News
> 
>   * Stories by DPGMN reports &#8212; page A2
>   * Associated Press stories &#8212; page A3
>   * UPI stories &#8212; page A4
>   * Stock information from Bloomberg &#8212; page B1
>   * Comics from King Features &#8212; page C1
>   * Comics from Joe Random Syndicator &#8212; page C2

So, you flip to page A2. And you see this:

>   * Area man charged in robbery &#8212; page A9
>   * Girl sells &#8220;best cookies in town&#8221; &#8212; page A10

This is essentially the presentation you&#8217;re getting in an Outlook-style aggregator. Granted, it&#8217;s quicker to click something on the screen than flip a page, but you get my point. Readers are more interested in the story itself than they are in the source of the story. Sure, the source of the story makes a difference in credibility and likelihood that the story is something interesting to you, but driving the user experience based on the source just seems wrong.

When I went to his conference last year, [Edward Tufte][4] talked about quality newspapers have been doing their thing for _100 years_ and more. Though the internet certainly changes things, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the lessons of the print papers are invalid.

After that, you won&#8217;t be surprised to hear that [Zesty News][5] is a River of News-syle aggregator. My early mockups were very newspaper-like: multiple columns, bigger headlines for bigger stories, etc. After some experience using the software that way, though, I realized that software has a big advantage over a print newspaper: unlimited space. Print newspapers use the format they do partly for readability and compactness. When moving to feeds on the screen, however, multiple columns are a lot harder to scan through than a single column.

I can prove it, too. Go to <a href="http://news.google.com" target="_blank">Google News</a> and first scan down the column on the left, looking at the headlines as you go. Then, go back up and try to scan both columns. With a single column, your eyes can move just a little bit to read the text. With two columns, your eyes have to dart left and right to scan. It may be a better workout for your eyes, but it&#8217;s not an easy way to get through a couple hundred items in a day.

I&#8217;ve got more to say about getting through those couple hundred items, but I&#8217;ll save that for another day.
