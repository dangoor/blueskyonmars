I posted my first such list on January 7th of this year. It&#8217;s a nice thing to look back on from time to time, so I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t start it earlier.

This year was something of a milestone for me. I think this is the first year since 1989 in which I did not buy a single CD. All of the new music I bought this year just came in the form of files. This is not really surprising, since I&#8217;ve been ripping my CDs and only listening to MP3s since 2000. My music all came from either iTunes Music Service or AllOfMP3.com.

While some artists may not like single-song sales, being able to purchase individual songs has been great. I&#8217;ve bought more music than I have in years, and a wider variety. I did buy a couple of full-albums, but I&#8217;ve tended to buy batches of songs.

So, with that preface out of the way, here are my favorite songs of 2004:

  * &#8220;Going Under&#8221;, **Evanescence**. I heard this once on the radio last year, but really got into it this year. Radio missed out on this one. It&#8217;s a great track! Evanescence had one of my favorites last year, too.
  * &#8220;Breaking The Habit&#8221;, **Linkin Park**. LP is also a repeat performer from last year. This is another great cut, and radio didn&#8217;t miss out on this one.
  * &#8220;Electrical Storm&#8221;, &#8220;Vertigo&#8221;, **U2**. &#8220;Electrical Storm&#8221; may not be a new song, but it&#8217;s new to me and has an excellent William Orbit production. &#8220;Vertigo&#8221; is just a great piece of rock. I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing more of this album, which I haven&#8217;t had a chance to do yet.
  * &#8220;Get Low&#8221;, &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go&#8221;, &#8220;Yeah!&#8221;, **Lil Jon and friends**. OK, so &#8220;Yeah!&#8221; is credited to Usher and &#8220;Let&#8217;s Go&#8221; goes to Trick Daddy, but we know who the star was. Lil Jon was all over the radio, and these three were my favorites. I&#8217;m not as fond of the music I&#8217;ve heard from Lil Jon&#8217;s new album. I think he&#8217;s probably jumped the shark already and 2005 will have distinctly less Lil Jon than 2004 did.
  * &#8220;Rest In Pieces&#8221;, **Saliva**
  * &#8220;Excuses&#8221;, **Alanis Morrissette**
  * &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s Home&#8221;, &#8220;Take Me Away&#8221;, &#8220;My Happy Ending&#8221;, **Avril Lavigne**. A trio of nicely done rockers. I wasn&#8217;t particularly fond of Avril&#8217;s stuff on the radio from her first album, but these are good songs. &#8220;Take Me Away&#8221; was a free iTMS download, and a good one at that!
  * &#8220;Let&#8217;s Get It Started&#8221;, **Black Eyed Peas**. Why these folks would make a song called &#8220;Let&#8217;s Get Retarded&#8221; is beyond me. But, it&#8217;s a fun, poppy song nonetheless. In it&#8217;s &#8220;Let&#8217;s Get It Started&#8221; form, it&#8217;s a bit less silly.
  * &#8220;Encore&#8221;, **Eminem**. &#8220;Lose It&#8221; wasn&#8217;t half the lead single that &#8220;Without Me&#8221; was. That said, &#8220;Encore&#8221; makes for a much better followup.
  * &#8220;Boulevard of Broken Drams&#8221;, **Green Day**. These guys have progressed mightily since their &#8220;Dookie&#8221; days.
  * &#8220;Harder To Breathe&#8221;, **Maroon5**. &#8220;This Love&#8221; is good, but not as good.
  * &#8220;Scandalous&#8221;, **Mis-Teeq**.
  * &#8220;Tilt Ya Head Back&#8221;, **Nelly & Christian Aguilera**. Super-slick production with solid performances from both leads. This is the song that should have been on radio over and over again.
  * &#8220;Soul Lover&#8221;, **Sophie B, Hawkins**. I&#8217;ve been a huge Sophie fan since Tongues and Tails. I don&#8217;t enjoy her new album as much as the previous three, but it still has some good tracks. &#8220;Soul Lover&#8221; is the best of the bunch, with a big, powerful chorus.

The year&#8217;s biggest disappointment for me, without a doubt, is **Duran Duran&#8217;s** new album. It&#8217;s been 20 years since they broke in the States, and a decade since their second coming with The Wedding Album. Reconstituted with the original members, you&#8217;d think all kinds of interesting stuff would have come along. Instead, we get an album of dreck. Better luck with the next one, guys. (Tip: maybe you should talk to Lil Jon.),

This year&#8217;s list has 19 songs, vs. last year&#8217;s 9. There could be all sorts of reasons for this: better releases, better availability of legal downloads, etc&#8230; whatever the reason may be, I&#8217;m happy to have come across so many enjoyable tunes this year.
