A link showed up on [Blogdex][1] for [Graphics and Web Design Based on Edward Tufte&#8217;s Principles][2]. For those not familiar with Tufte, he is the author of three very fine books: [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information][3], [Envisioning Information][4] and [Visual Explanations][5]. These books, which Tufte beautifully self-published, are filled with great examples (and counter-examples) of good ways to communicate information.

Tufte also wrote [a paper][6] on the woes of PowerPoint presentations. This makes it somewhat ironic that the &#8220;Graphics and Web Design Based On Edward Tufte&#8217;s Principles&#8221; boils down Tufte&#8217;s books into a bullet list outline. Sure, there&#8217;s more content there than in a typical PowerPoint presentation, but it still struck me as mildly amusing.

For those not familiar with Tufte, though, you might check out that outline for a taste of what&#8217;s in the books. The books are certainly a lot more visual, and I&#8217;d highly recommend them if the content in that outline sounds appealing. Tufte is also [a good speaker][7], if you happen to find him coming to your area.
