A group of 1360 scientists report that [two-thirds of world&#8217;s resources are being &#8216;used up&#8217;][1]:

> The human race is living beyond its means. A report backed by 1,360 scientists from 95 countries &#8211; some of them world leaders in their fields &#8211; today warns that the almost two-thirds of the natural machinery that supports life on Earth is being degraded by human pressure.

I have seen other warnings about human usage of freshwater. This is pretty scary stuff, and the United States is the worst abuser of them all. Our current administration does not just have its head in the sand on this one. They actively support those who gain financially from the exploitation of the Earth&#8217;s resources.

I&#8217;m a geek, not a Luddite. But, I&#8217;m a practical geek. I want this world to continue to exist after my retirement. I can&#8217;t imagine what it would be like for my daughter if we face the kind of freshwater shortage that is possible.
