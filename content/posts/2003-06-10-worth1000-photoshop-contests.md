This morning I encountered [Worth1000.com | Photoshop Contests | Are you Worthy?][1] for the first time. The actual link I had followed took me to a photoshop contest to do up [Martha Stewart&#8217;s jail cell][2]. Most amusing, and many of these photoshops were of very high quality (and creativity!).
