[Documenting your project using the Eclipse help system][1] is easier than you might think. This article shows you how, step-by-step. The Eclipse help system is pretty powerful, and for people who&#8217;ve standardized on Eclipse this seems like a positive idea. Keep in mind that Eclipse help is standard HTML/XML/JSP/whatever running behind Tomcat, so you&#8217;re not really tying yourself to Eclipse by adding the plugin wrapper.
