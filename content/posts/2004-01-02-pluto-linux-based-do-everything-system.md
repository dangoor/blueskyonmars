Ever wanted an easy-to-configure, whole-house, internet-accessible, Linux-based VOIP PBX with video, PVR, firewall/router, security system, MP3 player, file server, personal web server, home automation (lights, thermostat) controller? I just came across the [Pluto][1] which claims to do all of this (and more, of course!). It&#8217;ll set you back $15,000 if you&#8217;re living in a small bachelor pad, but you didn&#8217;t need that car anyway, did you?

After 14 failed attempts, I finally got something [posted to Slashdot][2]. I&#8217;m amazed that this hadn&#8217;t been on Slashdot before.
