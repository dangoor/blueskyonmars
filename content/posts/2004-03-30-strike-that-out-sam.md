[[strike out]][1] is a neat site that shows a little insight into Microsoft marketing folks in the form of Microsoft Word&#8217;s &#8220;Track Changes&#8221; feature. It looks like there are even people in Microsoft who don&#8217;t know how to use this feature correctly when posting a document online. The author of &#8220;Strike Out&#8221; found that 5% of the documents that tracked down on Microsoft&#8217;s site had deletions still tucked away within the document.

In truth, I don&#8217;t think that what you see on &#8220;Strike Out&#8221; is all that different from the types of edits that go on in marketing departments everywhere as marketeers try to hone their message for best response.
