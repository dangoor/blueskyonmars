I can&#8217;t wait for one of these articles to come along and say that someone has something available for purchase now. However, this article claims that [by the end of next year they&#8217;ll have solar cells 20 times cheaper than today&#8217;s][1]:

> Over a typical 20-year life span of a solar cell, a single produced watt should cost as little as $0.20, compared with the current $4.

They took an interesting and pragmatic approach: use materials that are less efficient, but dramatically cheaper, than the current state of the art. If I read this right, this means that a 3kW solar system will cost $600 instead of $12,000. Sign me up!
