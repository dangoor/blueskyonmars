The product that I&#8217;m working on has a codename now: Project Ladybug. My daughter chose the codename without knowing it. For several of her 18 months, she&#8217;s been fascinated by ladybugs. That seems as good a way to pick a codename as any!

After exploring a number of different avenues for getting design work done (including on a post here on Blue Sky On Mars), I have contracted with [Kirsten Climer][1] to do design work for Project Ladybug. She&#8217;s in her last semester at the University of Michigan and has done some very cool work.. I found her by emailing the [School of Art and Design][2] and received several responses within a few hours.
