I had forgotten about the impending [Eclipse 3.0 M6 release][1]. It looks like they&#8217;re moving into &#8220;smoothing&#8221; mode to put the proper polish on the 3.0 release. There was a tantalizing mention of running Eclipse 3.0 under an early access Sun JDK 1.5, but no mention of support for 1.5-specific features. There are a number of nice refinements listed (including full access to the new Java source formatter), so if you&#8217;re running 3.0 you&#8217;ll probably want to grab it!
