There&#8217;s a couple of bits of interesting news in RSS land. First, Bloglines has [added package tracking][1] to the list of feeds you can get. That&#8217;s a handy feature, and something I can guarantee I&#8217;ll have more to say about later.

The other bit is that some newspapers [are creating their own RSS readers][2]. I learned a lot about newspapers when I was at [CareerSite][3], because CareerSite&#8217;s customers were newspapers. Some newspapers are painfully old-guard and might start thinking about that internet thing in a few years, because it&#8217;s probably just a fad. (That&#8217;s an exaggeration, of course.) The Denver Post is one of the more clued-in newspapers, so it&#8217;s not surprising to see that they&#8217;re one of the ones creating their own RSS readers. They&#8217;ve spied a threat and, rather than trying to sue it away, they&#8217;re facing it head-on and figuring out how to make a business out of it. I can think of a couple of industries that could use a good whack with that cluestick (that&#8217;s you, MPAA and RIAA!)
