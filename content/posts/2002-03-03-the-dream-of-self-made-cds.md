As much as people hate to think that the major labels determine which music is &#8220;good&#8221;, the fact of the matter is that most people don&#8217;t spend hours and hours searching for music. They either hear it on the radio (which requires promo dollars), or they hear of it through word of mouth. Word of mouth will always be a mechanism through which independent artists can gain some popularity. But, there&#8217;s nothing like major label money for getting an artist known. (Of course, just having major label money doesn&#8217;t guarantee any success. The majors release 6,400 albums a year.)
