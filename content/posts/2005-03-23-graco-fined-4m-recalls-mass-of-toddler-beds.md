For many parents in the US, the name Graco is usually associated with top quality, well-engineered baby products. Apparently, though, Graco has not been diligently reporting injuries that have occurred through use of their toddler beds and was [fined $4M as a result][1].

> &#8221;At Graco, the safety and welfare of our consumers is always our top priority,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;As this settlement makes clear, it is our understanding that Graco did not knowingly violate the CPSC&#8217;s reporting requirements.&#8221;

The article doesn&#8217;t go into detail about how they misunderstood CPSC&#8217;s reporting requirements&#8230; but, Graco&#8217;s been at this a while. They&#8217;re a big company that is part of an even bigger public compnay. It&#8217;s easy to be skeptical and think that perhaps Graco just didn&#8217;t want to get involved in recalling 1.2 million toddler beds if they could avoid it.
