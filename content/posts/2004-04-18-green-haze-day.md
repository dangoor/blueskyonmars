An interesting thing happens every year (and it&#8217;s interesting despite the fact that it happens every year). One morning, we wake up, and there is suddenly a green haze of budding leaves out in back of our house. One day, it&#8217;s all brown. The next day, it&#8217;s getting green at eye level. The taller trees take a bit longer to bud. It&#8217;s a nice phenomenon, and today was the day that it happened this year. Could have something to do with the 70+ degree weather.
