Mark Ramm goes into a bit of detail over the recent speculation of [Merging TurboGears and Pylons?][1] I had a [comment about this on the Pylons][2] mailing list as well. Those of us using Python to develop webapps have a great variety of tools to work with.

It&#8217;s worth noting that I (and many others) like the style/feel of TurboGears apps (which is to say CherryPy-style dispatch by default and Genshi templates). Though TurboGears and Pylons currently share a good bit of code and will undoubtedly share more, it&#8217;s the style/feel thing that represents the difference between the two frameworks that may not resolve itself. (Of course, TG apps will be able to use Routes+Mako if desired, and Pylons apps can use CherryPy/RhubarbTart+Genshi if desired&#8230; those just won&#8217;t be out of the box defaults&#8230;)
