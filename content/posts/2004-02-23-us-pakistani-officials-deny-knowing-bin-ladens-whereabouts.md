Yesterday, Britain&#8217;s Sunday Express reported that US forces had Osama bin Laden surrounded. Today, [U.S., Pakistan Deny They&#8217;re Closing in on Osama][1].

> Osama bin Laden&#8217;s whereabouts remain a mystery to U.S. and Pakistani forces as they crank up efforts to flush out al Qaeda and Taliban rebels hiding near Afghanistan&#8217;s eastern frontier, officials said on Monday.

I don&#8217;t remember where I first read this idea, but someone out there suspected that the US will hold off on capturing or announcing the capture of bin Laden until closer to the election. Personally, I think that would be going a bit far as political stunts go, and I think that unlikely. But, if bin Laden is captured close to the election, I just hope that people will keep things in perspective. Capturing bin Laden is not going to stop a decentralized group like al Qaeda.
