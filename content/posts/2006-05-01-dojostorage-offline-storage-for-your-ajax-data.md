This is some most excellent stuff: [Brad Neuberg: Offline Access and Permanent, Client-Side Storage, Thanks to Dojo.Storage][1]. Here&#8217;s a packaged up way to store megabytes (if you need to) permanently on the user&#8217;s computer, as long as they&#8217;re using one of the browsers used by 95%+ of the population. This is not the kind of capability that everyone needs, but when it&#8217;s right for your app you didn&#8217;t really have a way until now.
