Eric Sink wrote about choosing software platforms in [Be Careful Where You Build][1] on MSDN. Eric has written a number of good, practical articles based on his experience at SourceGear. It shows a lot of editorial integrity that this article appears on MSDN, because it provides realistic portrayals of how things stand with Windows (MFC), Windows (.NET), the Mac, Java and Linux. His central theme is absolutely correct: it&#8217;s all about the user.
