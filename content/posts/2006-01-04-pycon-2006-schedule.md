The [PyCon 2006 Schedule][1] is up! (It was presented as being &#8220;close to final&#8221;, so keep that in mind.) Mark Ramm&#8217;s TurboGears Tutorial is on the first day, and my Effective AJAX in TurboGears is on the last. If you&#8217;re into TurboGears, see if you can stay a day or two after for the Sprint! See you there!
