The Memory Hole resurrects an article by George Bush Sr.:<a title="The Memory Hole >Reasons Not to Invade Iraq, by George Bush Sr.&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www.thememoryhole.org/mil/bushsr-iraq.htm&#8221;>The Reasons Not to Invade Iraq</a>, which Time Magazine removed [from the table of contents][1] of the 1998 issue in which the article appeared. Since when does the press work for the White House? This is not good for whatever credibility Time had.
