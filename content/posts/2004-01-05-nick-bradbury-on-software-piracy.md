Nick Bradbury, author of TopStyle and FeedDemon [laments the cost of piracy to his business][1]. There is some [interesting discussion][2] in the trackbacks, including some pointers as to why the [figures Nick uses aren&#8217;t accurate][3].

New models will have to grow up, but no one has yet identified a solid winner of a model.
