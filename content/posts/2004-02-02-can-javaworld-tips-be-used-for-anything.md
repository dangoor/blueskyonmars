JavaWorld has published a good deal of potentially useful information, and it&#8217;s a shame to see them stop. I say &#8220;potentially useful&#8221; because it&#8217;s hard to tell if you&#8217;re actually allowed to use the information. Take a look at the [JavaWorld.com Copyright Information][1]. It&#8217;s all standard seeming stuff for a publication&#8230; no reprints or redistribution, except for personal, non-commercial use. That seems fine for articles, but there are useful pieces of code there. The only terms listed are those on the copyright page, so I have to assume that JavaWorld code cannot be redistributed.

This seems to limit the usefulness of the information, because it would be a possible copyright violation to even take snippets of the code.

I&#8217;ve actually spotted JavaWorld code in an open source project. Is that allowed?
