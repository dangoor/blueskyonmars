I&#8217;m not sure how I missed this&#8230; [ImageJ][1] is image processing and analysis software in Java. This is complete, with UI, macros and plugins (a whole host of &#8217;em!) to do all kinds of image processing. It also claims to be quite fast, desptie not requiring a native library like JAI.

Oh yeah, and it&#8217;s public domain. (Your tax dollars at work, if you&#8217;re in the US&#8230; And if you&#8217;re not in the US, enjoy it on us! ðŸ™‚
