Tomorrow is my last day at [JSTOR][1]. Today, the folks in the Production and Technical groups gave me a nice send off and lots of well-wishes for my new business. JSTOR has a great work environment and is filled with great people (that&#8217;s probably why the work environment is so good!).

JSTOR is providing a hugely valuable service to the scholarly community, and there are all sorts of great things going on to make it even better.

So, to my friends at JSTOR: thanks for a most excellent time, and good luck for the future
