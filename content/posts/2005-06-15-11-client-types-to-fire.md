Christopher Hawkins has written a great piece about [11 types of software project clients that you should fire][1]. I think everyone who has been doing software for a while has worked with some suboptimal clients. I worked on one project where the customer was very nitpicky and detail-oriented, and yet they couldn&#8217;t make up their mind about the details! Couple that with problems on our side from a codebase that wasn&#8217;t aging gracefully, and that was an unhappy project that I worked on for more than a year.

Unfortunately, it was a strategic relationship and it was not in my hands to fire the customer. As I understand it, this project continued on for another year and a half after I left before finally being put out of everyone&#8217;s misery.
