Florent Aide has just released [TurboGears 1.0.3][1]. Congrats to Florent on a release with a whole bunch of good things! (See the [changelog][2]).

Florent and Mark Ramm have been pushing things forward at a great clip for TurboGears 1 and 2. Stay tuned (or even better, get involved!) for the coming 1.1 and 2.0a releases.
