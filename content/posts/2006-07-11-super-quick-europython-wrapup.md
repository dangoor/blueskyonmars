I&#8217;m very tardy in writing anything on my blog, particular given how much I&#8217;ve had going on. I certainly would like to write more. I had a great time in Geneva, heard a number of interesting talks there, saw cool things at CERN and in town, and met many interesting and talented Python folks. I also got to speak quite a bit and took part in a fun web framework shootout. Reinout van Rees summarized my [Working together on the web][1] talk. I have a couple of corrections for that, but I&#8217;m going to be mostly in &#8220;radio silence&#8221; mode for the next couple of weeks because the book is coming due&#8230;
