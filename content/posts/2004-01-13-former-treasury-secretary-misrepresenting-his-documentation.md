This week former Treasury Secretary Paul O&#8217;Neill and author Ron Suskind have been [on the attack][1], making claims that the Bush administration was planning to invade Iraq well before 9/11. The claims are believable, because this administration has had a bit of a credibility problem. But, this article: [Power Line: Lid Blown Off O&#8217;Neill/Suskind Hoax][2] shows that some of O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s claims seem to be a bit of a stretch:

> So the &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; documents that Suskind and O&#8217;Neill claim prove that the administration was planning to invade Iraq in March 2001 are part of a package that includes identical documents relating to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.

This is a good article with good links. Unless other evidence comes forth, it seems like it&#8217;s just O&#8217;Neill&#8217;s word against the administration&#8217;s and I wouldn&#8217;t be inclined to take either at their word.
