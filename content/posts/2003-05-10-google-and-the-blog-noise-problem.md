Andrew Orlowski writes in [&#8220;Google to fix blog noise problem&#8221;][1] that Google is taking steps to change their algorithms to avoid skew caused by blogs. Personally, I find this kind of crazy. I use Google all the time, and have great success in finding what I&#8217;m looking for. Blogs generally link to content produced by others, so it seems to me that they do a good job of boosting content that is valuable. Maybe Google&#8217;s algorithms give too much preference to blogs if there is a &#8220;recentness&#8221; part of their scoring algorithm, but on the whole I think they do a good job of results. Something to consider, too, is that many blogs include not only links to other things, but original writing that is often very useful.

One thing that I can agree with is that you wouldn&#8217;t want Trackback links to influence rankings. The Google folks are pretty smart, and I think they can deal with that problem without eliminating blog entries from search results entirely.
