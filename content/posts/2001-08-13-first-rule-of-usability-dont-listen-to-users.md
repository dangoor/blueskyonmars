[Jakob Nielsen says][1]: _&#8220;To discover which designs work best, watch users as they attempt to perform tasks with the user interface. This method is so simple that many people overlook it, assuming that there must be something more to usability testing.&#8221;_ Another interesting article from Jakob.
