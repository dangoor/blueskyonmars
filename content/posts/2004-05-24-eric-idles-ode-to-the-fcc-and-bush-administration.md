Thank goodness that the Net still has free speech. [The FCC Song][1] is a little ditty written by Eric Idle. I don&#8217;t know if he was actually fined by the FCC or is just making a commentary, but it&#8217;s quite a commentary. Don&#8217;t listen at work. Direct link to the song: [The FCC Song][2]
