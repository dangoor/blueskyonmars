Peru has a bill that is proposing using only free software for the government. Microsoft did not approve and wrote a letter to the Peruvian government. A Congressman [replied with rebuttals to all of Microsoft&#8217;s points][1]. Reading this letter, you can see that he&#8217;s really thought about this stuff. You&#8217;ll note that the primary reason he argues for free software is not cost: it&#8217;s availability of information to the public and national security.
