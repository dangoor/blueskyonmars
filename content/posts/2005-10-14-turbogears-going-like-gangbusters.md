After the slashdotting, Ian Landsman wondered what the extended effect of the slashdotting would be. Certainly, after serving more than 13,000 views of the screencast on Monday, things have tapered off. The 20 Minute Wiki is still getting 1,000 views a day! (That&#8217;s 80GB per day, for those watching their <strike>waistline</strike> bandwidth usage). I haven&#8217;t had a chance to do a total tally, but I&#8217;m guessing that the screencast is up to 25,000 views.

The main TurboGears discussion Google Group has added about 100 people since Monday, crossing 350 earlier today. The announcements list crossed 100 today. Mailing list traffic is increasing, and people are coming up with some cool stuff. Interesting things are taking shape for 0.9!

Thanks to all of the people putting their energy into TurboGears!
