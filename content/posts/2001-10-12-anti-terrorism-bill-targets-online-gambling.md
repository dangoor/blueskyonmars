It&#8217;s common practice in Congress to attach potentially unpopular legislation to a &#8220;guaranteed to pass&#8221; bill. This isn&#8217;t a case of that&#8230; According to [this Wired article][1], the FBI has linked online gambling with fund raising for the terrorists. Therefore, a bill in the House would give credit card companies the burden of watching out for online gamblers.

Weird. I&#8217;m definitely on the side of [this article on The Onion][2] when it comes to these bills. If America is so great because of the freedoms we have, why are we giving them up? (Note: that last comment is an aside&#8230; online gambling is not something we&#8217;re &#8220;giving up&#8221;. It was already basically illegal, and you&#8217;d have to be a fool to gamble at an offshore gambling site anyhow.)
