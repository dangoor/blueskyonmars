Two weeks ago, I [wrote][1] about how it took me 40 minutes to pick up an order from Best Buy. I just wanted to post a follow-up saying that the only response I received to my message to customer service was the canned &#8220;we&#8217;re sorry for the inconvenience and have forwarded your message on to the appropriate people&#8221;. I guess that&#8217;s ok with me if they do, in fact, forward the message on and something happens.

But, that response doesn&#8217;t give me a lot of confidence that they really paid attention. I wasn&#8217;t expecting them to give me something for my trouble, but it would at least be nice to know that they&#8217;re going to try to fix the problem for the future.
