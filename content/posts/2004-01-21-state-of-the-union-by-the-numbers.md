The Independent has gathered up a bunch of stats to show the [real state of the union][1], and it&#8217;s not pretty. Some figures seem to be there for dramatic effect and are not very meaningful. Some are enlightening, though. (Did you know that 88% of American households will save less than $100 because of the capital gains cuts, whereas Cheney will save more than $100,000?)
