[J.A.D.E. Java Addition to Default Environment][1] is a library of several packages that go beyond the J2SE core functionality. There are a number of classes for scientific/mathematic use, but there are also other goodies like a superfast XML parser and a collection of classes that avoid garbage collection. (Of course, if you&#8217;ve been following the articles about Java GC, you&#8217;d know that the current garbage collectors don&#8217;t tend to be quite so icky when you create lots of objects.)
