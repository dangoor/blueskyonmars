Now that I&#8217;m using my Mac at least as much as my PC at home, a cross-platform sound editor seems like a good thing. Not having to buy one seems like a good thing, too. [Audacity][1] is a free, open source, sound editor that works on both the Mac and Windows. On Windows, I&#8217;ve already got Sound Forge, so I don&#8217;t know how likely it is that I&#8217;ll use Audicity there. Just depends on how easy/stable/featureful it is.
