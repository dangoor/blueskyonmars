So, the word on the street is that [Netscape staffers have been slashed][1], which is far from surprising given AOL&#8217;s deal to include Internet Explorer for the next few years. [Mozilla][2] work continues via the [Mozilla Foundation][3], to which AOL has pledged $2 million. Reportedly, the number of Mozilla volunteers is now exceeding the number of people who were paid by Netscape to work on it, so this could just be an interesting, new, independent phase for Moz.
