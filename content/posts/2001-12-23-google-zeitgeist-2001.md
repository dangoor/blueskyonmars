Google has an interesting page showing [what people were searching for in 2001][1]. Unfortunately, the link doesn&#8217;t look like a permalink. They really should archive it, because it&#8217;s interesting. I noticed that they didn&#8217;t have an overall Top Queries list, they just had top gainers and top decliners. I find it interesting that the top woman was a 20 year old pop singer (Britney Spears), and the top man was a guy who died more than 300 years ago (Nostradamus).
