In general, I like movies that I watch to be good. However, [The Smithee Awards][1] has given me an appreciation for just how fun a bad movie can be. [Bad Movies.org][2] serves up reviews of a bunch of bad movies, including photos, sounds and sometimes movie clips. Check out [Star Crash][3] for an example of how entertainingly bad a movie can be.
