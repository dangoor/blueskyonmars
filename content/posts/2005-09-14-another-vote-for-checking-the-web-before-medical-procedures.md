In May, I wrote [Poor Weight Gain: A Cautionary Tale][1] to stress how important it is to do your own research before accepting a negative diagnosis. As much as a good doctor knows, it&#8217;s impossible for one person to know it all. A letter received by Google from [parents of a premie twin that were told he needed a blood transfusion][2] talks about a very serious scenario in which doing a search on Google avoided a dangerous procedure.

I do wonder at what point it becomes standard operating procedure for medical staff to do searches to find the latest information before prescribing such a treatment. That would seem to be more productive than less-educated parents doing the searches. But, ultimately, we are our own best advocates for great health care, so it will always pay to be in the know ourselves.
