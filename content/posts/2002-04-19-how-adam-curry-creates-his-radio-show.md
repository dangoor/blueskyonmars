Adam Curry, most famous for his run as an MTV veejay a few years back, described [how he prepares his radio program][1]. He lives in The Netherlands and has a weekly show on a popular station. The only songs that get played are ones he can get through Morpheus. On the one hand, the record labels get nothing from him downloading the songs that way. On the other, the songwriters do get royalties because he downloads them with the express purpose of playing them on the radio.

The Internet truly does force content companies to rethink the way they&#8217;re packaging things. Unfortunately, the big content companies currently seem opposed to rethinking things (because they&#8217;re quite happy with the billions they&#8217;ve been taking in, thank you very much).
