Over the years, I&#8217;ve done a variety of reviews. I&#8217;ve also consumed a lot more books, music, movies and websites than I&#8217;ve managed to review or mention here. I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;d really like to highlight some of the great things that I&#8217;ve found along the way.

**Marketing**

[ ![Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable][1]][2]Purple Cow by Seth Godin

This is one of those books that will have you thinking &#8220;well, duh! Of course, you should do that!&#8221; But then you&#8217;ll realize that most companies _don&#8217;t_ do these things. This is important stuff to read and ponder if you&#8217;re a product manager or starting your own product business. I actually listened to the audio book of Purple Cow as a [Free Prize Inside / Purple Cow combo audiobook][3]. These books will help you think better about your products, whether you&#8217;re in a big company or a one man show. You can check out my [January 2005][4] review. Even better, keep an eye on [Seth&#8217;s blog][5], where you can regularly get it drummed into you that being different and better is the key to success. (**Added January 1, 2006**)

[![The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Profitable Decision Making (3rd Edition)][6]][7] The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing by Thomas Nagle and Reed Holden

This was a recommendation from Joel Spolsky, and it&#8217;s a good one. Nagle and Holden give you plenty to think about and ideas on how to approach the problem of pricing. If you think cost + some profit margin is the way to price your product, you owe it to yourself to buy this book. It has the potential to make you a ton of money or save you a ton on a wasted product development effort.
  
**Management**

[![Winning][8]][9] Winning by Jack Welch

This book has one of the most compelling testimonial quotes you&#8217;ll ever see: &#8220;No other management book will ever be needed&#8221;, said by none other than Warren Buffett. I&#8217;ve read a number of management books, mostly in the realm of software team management. Truly, though, this book covers the essence of management far better than the others I&#8217;ve read. Jack Welch gives people management the kind of attention it deserves, and this book is a must read for anyone that is managing other people. (**Added January 1, 2006**)
