The Ann Arbor News has an article about [Erica Knopper][1], who died on Monday. She had been in a coma for 10 days after being struck by a car. Surekha worked with her husband, Mark, and I had met her once or twice. The Knoppers are very nice people, and this is a real tragedy.
  
Update: Mark has sent the link for information on [Erica Knopper&#8217;s Origami Peace Foundation][2], and Erica&#8217;s origami pictures.
