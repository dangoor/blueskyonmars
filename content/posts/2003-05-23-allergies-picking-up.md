This evening, my allergies seem to be bothering me a bit. Last weekend, we went out to a park and I was fine. According to [pollen.com][1], the pollen level was high that day, and I remember that oak was one of the predominant pollens. We have a big oak across the street, and since I was fine then, it probably wasn&#8217;t the oak. Predominant pollens listed now are oak, mulberry and grass. By keeping track here, maybe I&#8217;ll notice a trend about which pollens are listed as predominant when my allergies strike. Luckily, my allergies are not that bad and end before the first official day of summer.
