I needed to call Lufthansa, and they [don&#8217;t make it very easy][1] to get their phone number. A couple screens in on [Lufthansa&#8217;s USA site][2], you&#8217;ll get the (800) 645-3880 phone number.

Here&#8217;s the interesting bit: I called that number and got through to your typical &#8220;press 1 if you would like to hold for 5 minutes&#8221;, &#8220;press 2 if you would like to hold for 7 minutes&#8221; sort of menu. While I was holding for reservations, I remembered calling a different number ending in LUFT previously, not getting any kind of menu and not waiting at all for an agent.

The number is **800-399-LUFT** and it took me straight to reservations and a person answered right away. I had somehow tracked this number down via the main Lufthansa site, even though Lufthansa USA would prefer that you wait several minutes before they talk to you.
