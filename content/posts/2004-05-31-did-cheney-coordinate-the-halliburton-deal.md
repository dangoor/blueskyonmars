According to [Time Magazine][1], he did.

> The e-mail says Feith approved arrangements for the contract &#8220;contingent on informing WH [White House] tomorrow. We anticipate no issues since action has been coordinated w VP&#8217;s [Vice President&#8217;s] office.&#8221; Three days later, the Army Corps of Engineers gave Halliburton the contract, without seeking other bids. TIME located the e-mail among documents provided by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group.

This is the trouble that a secretive government will run into. If this was the kind of government that promptly answered FOIA requests and acted generally trustworthy, rather than trying to block energy policy information in court, people might give them the benefit of doubt. There&#8217;s really nothing to make us trust Cheney on this, though.
