[Salon.com Books | The morality police][1]: _&#8220;Cloaking themselves in concern for the welfare of children, censors have managed to successfully paint the people who oppose them as willing corruptors of children.&#8221;_ A lucid argument in defense of free speech that also takes the interesting perspective that minors are not all innocent and are also that there&#8217;s no proof that they&#8217;re harmed by the media.
