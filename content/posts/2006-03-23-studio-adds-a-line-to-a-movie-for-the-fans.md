[In shooting additional footage for &#8220;Snakes on a Plane&#8221;][1]. New Line has added in a line that was demanded by fans. Strangely, they were shooting additional footage to ensure that the movie goes from PG-13 to R. Though it&#8217;s not the kind of movie I&#8217;m generally inclined to see, I gotta say that sticking with the &#8220;Snakes on a Plane&#8221; title was a great move. You just know exactly what you&#8217;re going to get. (Hmm&#8230; Star Wars Episode II: Wooden Actors, Bad Script, But Yoda Kicks Butt)
