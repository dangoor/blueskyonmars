Since Jon Udell&#8217;s been all over &#8220;screencasts&#8221; lately, it&#8217;s good to know what screen capture tools are available. I&#8217;ve just updated my original blog post about [screen capture tools][1] from January to include [CamStudio][2]. Unlike Wink, CamStudio does audio and video right now. Well worth a look.
