Uchi Ogbuji [spotted][1] a Slashdot comment by Ian Bicking explaining why [TurboGears is not a Rails clone][2]. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve come out and said it, but what Ian said sums things up quite well. TurboGears is [every bit as compelling as Rails][3], but it&#8217;s not a clone. It&#8217;s built as an integration of preexisting components, to give you the full front-to-back development stack. We have lots of good tools and ideas to choose from and Rails is not the only idea well from which we&#8217;ll be drinking.

Though the parts of TurboGears are not clones of Rails features, David Heinemeier Hansson deserves huge credit for showing what a full stack web application framework could look like at a time when most tools, open source ones in particular, were designed to tackle only one piece of the puzzle.
