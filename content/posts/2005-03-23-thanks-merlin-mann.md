So, here I am, writing this post up in [Markdown][1] style using [TextMate][2] with my [Hipster PDA][3] close at hand. Feeling like a [Merlin Mann][4] stooge, I can kind of understand the
  
[&#8220;Damn you, Merlin Mann&#8221;][5] sentiment.

Instead, though, I&#8217;ll just say, &#8220;Thanks!&#8221; Merlin&#8217;s tips have been helpful, his posts interesting and so far [Getting Things Done][6] has been helpful.
