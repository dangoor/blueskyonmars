I&#8217;ve been following Ian Landsman&#8217;s development of HelpSpot since the beginning, and it is very interesting to observe his attention to detail. Check out his [latest preview][1]. I worked in a network operations center some years back (and developed tools for them as well), so I have an idea about &#8220;trouble ticket&#8221; systems.

Ian is building software that is &#8220;subtly innovative&#8221;. If you&#8217;re entering an established market and produce something that is wildly different from everything else out there, you&#8217;ll have an uphill battle getting people to use it. What I see in Ian&#8217;s preview is that he&#8217;s providing some new ways of doing things and thinking about things that are unsurprising and natural.

Seems like a great software design strategy: unless you&#8217;re in some brand new market and you&#8217;re inventing the rules, make the overall experience follow what the user expects, but pay attention to the details because that&#8217;s where you can really improve the experience.
