Probably one of the best articles you&#8217;ll see with a succinct message about how we&#8217;re doing all of the wrong things in the face of a terrorist threat:
  
[Schneier on Security: What the Terrorists Want][1]

> Another thought experiment: Imagine for a moment that the British government arrested the 23 suspects without fanfare. Imagine that the TSA and its European counterparts didn&#8217;t engage in pointless airline-security measures like banning liquids. And imagine that the press didn&#8217;t write about it endlessly, and that the politicians didn&#8217;t use the event to remind us all how scared we should be. If we&#8217;d reacted that way, then the terrorists would have truly failed.
