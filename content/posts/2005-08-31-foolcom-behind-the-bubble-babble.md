Do you remember all of the analysts talking about the wide open skies for internet stocks and the &#8220;new economy&#8221;? The Fool is trashing the folks who claim there&#8217;s no housing bubble in the enjoyably titled [Behind the Bubble Babble][1]:

> The very people most vehement about denying a housing bubble are precisely the people who have the most to gain from seeing one continue: mortgage sellers and realtors.

It always pays to look at where a quote or story is coming from. I liked this part:

> Last time I checked, my paycheck was not contingent upon urging all of you to watch out for risky loans.

Actually, in a roundabout way, his paycheck does hinge on that&#8230; and providing other sound financial advice.

That&#8217;s what&#8217;s great about the Fool. Their articles cut through the hype in financial markets to try to give you a clearer picture of how things look.
