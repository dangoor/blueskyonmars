Ian Bicking [pointed to][1] [O&#8217;Reilly Connection][2], which is actually a pretty interesting looking site. It&#8217;s a combination of social networking software and a jobs board for software developers and people who want to hire them.

Given how many jobs are found via people you know, this is a logical step, and the implementation looks good. Of course, it looks like it&#8217;s just getting started (192 people with the &#8220;python&#8221; tag, 320 with the &#8220;java&#8221; tag). Something like this needs to hit critical mass before it becomes viable.
