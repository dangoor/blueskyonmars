This morning, I was having a hard time remembering the rather obvious name of this site: [Rebate-Tracker.com][1] does just what it sounds. It helps you track rebates that you&#8217;re expecting to receive. This can be important, because I just had to send an email message to a company because twice they&#8217;ve agreed that I&#8217;m owed the rebate and I still haven&#8217;t gotten the check. I&#8217;ve actually had good luck overall with rebates, and don&#8217;t quite follow the attitude that some people have that receiving a rebate should be considered a &#8220;bonus&#8221; and that you should be happy with the price you paid at the store. If a company is not intending to pay out rebates that they offer, that is fraud, plain and simple.
