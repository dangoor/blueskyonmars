When I first released TurboGears, I got a lot of questions about why I chose package X instead of package Y. When you&#8217;re talking about any sufficiently mature set of packages, trying to answer a question like that is an invitation to an endless discussion. I refer to that as the &#8220;emacs vs. vi&#8221; debate, since that&#8217;s the example that&#8217;s been with us for a _long_ time. I&#8217;m all ears when one solution is _demonstrably_ better for a task than another, but more often than not it&#8217;s a six-of-one, half-dozen-of-another sort of deal.

So, I shouldn&#8217;t be too surprised that a thread I started yesterday about [a triviality][1] would result in more than 50 messages from more than 30 people. I could&#8217;ve just flipped a coin, I guess ðŸ™‚

Update: Hey! I learned something new from this thread. I learned about [bike shed painting][2]. Neat.
