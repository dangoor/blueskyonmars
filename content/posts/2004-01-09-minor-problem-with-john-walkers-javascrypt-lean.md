John Walker&#8217;s really nifty [JavaScrypt: Browser-Based Cryptography Tools][1] comes in a monolithic &#8220;lean&#8221; version, which you can theoretically cart around with you and use on demand. I discovered that this version wasn&#8217;t working for me offline, because utf-8.js was still externally referenced.

This would be super simple for John to fix, but he doesn&#8217;t have any contact info on his [website][2]. So, I&#8217;ll post this here and maybe he&#8217;ll eventually notice ðŸ™‚
