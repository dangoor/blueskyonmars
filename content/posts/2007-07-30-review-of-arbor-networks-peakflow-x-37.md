For those who might be curious what I&#8217;ve been working on for the past year, check this out: [ITPro: Reviews: EXCLUSIVE: Arbor Networks Peakflow X 3.7][1]. 5 stars out of 6. Six star reviews seem a little strange, but I&#8217;m happy to see Peakflow X getting more additional positive press.

If you saw my release of TGWebServices in February, that work was done for the 3.7 release of Peakflow X.
