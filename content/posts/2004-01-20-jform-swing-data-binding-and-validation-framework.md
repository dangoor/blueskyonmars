Via JavaGeek, I came across [JForm][1] which does data binding and validation. The approach looks interesting, but it is different from one I have been thinking of. I&#8217;ve been thinking of something that does data binding in a dynamically typed manner, which provides quite a bit of flexibility for the kind of data model you&#8217;re working with. JForm does implement some interesting features, though, such as automatic validation and highlighting of the field that is being edited.
