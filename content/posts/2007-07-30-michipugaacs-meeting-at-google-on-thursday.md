As I mentioned previously, the August meeting of the Michigan Python Users Group is a joint meeting with the Ann Arbor Computer Society at the Google office in Ann Arbor. I have just found out what our meeting topic is&#8230;

Russell Whitaker, a Google software engineer, will be talking about Test Driven Development in Python. I was test infected a long time ago and I&#8217;ll certainly be interested to see if Russell has some tricks I haven&#8217;t seen yet ðŸ™‚

If you&#8217;re new to TDD, this is sure to be a good meeting.

**Update:** Registration has closed&#8230; we&#8217;ve got a full house.
