I&#8217;m adding [John Buckman&#8217;s blog to my blogroll][1]. He&#8217;s the founder of Magnatune, the &#8220;We are not evil&#8221; record label. His talk of [why there&#8217;s no African music][2] shows how not-evil they are. It&#8217;s also great to see that they&#8217;ve signed up distribution deals with EMusic, iTunes and Napster. Let&#8217;s hear it for the alternative music industry!
