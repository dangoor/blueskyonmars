Evan Williams of Pyra [talks about his recent problems with PayPal.][1] I haven&#8217;t yet used my PayPal account for anything, but what he&#8217;s describing can be a huge issue for any business trying to use PayPal as their payment system. This is foolish behavior that PP will have to correct quickly if they want to survive. (BTW, this was #3 on DayPop, so people have taken notice.)
