On [Yahoo! News][1] this morning: &#8220;Israeli opinion moves against Gaza pullout foes&#8221;. Though that headline is an accurate portrayal of what&#8217;s in the story, the negatives (against, pullout and foes) make my head spin. &#8220;Israelis favor Gaza pullout&#8221; is more succinct, but doesn&#8217;t capture the fact that there has been literally violent opposition to the pullout. It could be worse:

> &#8220;Foes of Israeli opinion argue against not staying in the vicinity of the pullout&#8221;
