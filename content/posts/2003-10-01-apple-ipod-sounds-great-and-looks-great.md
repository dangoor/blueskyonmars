Even the packaging of my new [Apple iPod][1] was a work of art. I&#8217;ve got a Nomad Jukebox C which I&#8217;m selling (if you&#8217;re interested). The iPod is a fabulous device&#8230; easy and quick controls, fast transfer, great sound quality, excellent form factor and design. Not much to complain about, really. I&#8217;m looking forward to getting an [iTrip][2] to go with it.
