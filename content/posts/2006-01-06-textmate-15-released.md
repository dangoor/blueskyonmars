I&#8217;ve been using the beta version of [TextMate][1] (a great Mac text editor) so long, I had forgotten about the possibility of an actual release. Well, version 1.5 is out! I&#8217;m guessing that everyone using TextMate has been using beta versions, so it&#8217;s just a tiny rev over what we&#8217;ve been running. But, for anyone who isn&#8217;t using TextMate this may be a chance to check it out again. There&#8217;s now an [official screencast][2] (one of my screencasts also appears on that page!)
