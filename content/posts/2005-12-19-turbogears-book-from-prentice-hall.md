It&#8217;s official!

After a month of discussions with two different publishers (both of
  
which sounded quite excited about the project), Mark Ramm and I have
  
agreed to write a TurboGears book for Prentice Hall. Prentice Hall is
  
the largest technical publisher in the world and will provide
  
excellent marketing and distribution support for the book. The
  
worldwide reach is important, as TurboGears has many users outside of
  
the US.

We&#8217;re working with Mark Taub, who has experience publishing books for
  
other open source projects. Mark also worked with Bruce Perens on
  
Bruce&#8217;s series of books at Prentice Hall.

We&#8217;re grateful for the positive reviews and useful input our proposal
  
received from some notable names in the Python world. This project is
  
going to be a lot of fun, and we can&#8217;t wait to get it out there.
