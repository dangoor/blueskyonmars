In this [interview with Tim O&#8217;Reilly][1], he talks about:

> EBay Inc. will someday buy Oracle, open source licenses don&#8217;t work, and the software market is about to change forever.

Very interesting interview. He says that Amazon.com is possibly the farthest along the path to the future in that they have this critical mass of a customer base that provides a whole lot of data and value and that they are exploiting it by providing commerce services for many people and offering web services that allow people to create all sorts of applications that they themselves wouldn&#8217;t necessarily think of.
