In the link to Dave&#8217;s site below, you&#8217;ll see a quote from a message posted by John Perry Barlow likening the events of 9/11 to the Nazi takeover of the German government. &#8220;Within a few hours, we will see beginning the most vigorous efforts to end what remains of freedom in America. Those of who are willing to sacrifice a little &#8211; largely illusory &#8211; safety in order to maintain our faith in the original ideals of America will have to fight for those ideals just as vigorously.&#8221;

The Constitution and Bill of Rights were created for a reason. Let&#8217;s ensure that we keep those rights throughout anything that comes.
