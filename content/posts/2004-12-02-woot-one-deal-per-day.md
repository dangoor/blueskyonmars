Wanna buy some random, probably electronic, item at a cheap price? Happen to be up at midnight, central time? [Woot!][1] is the place for you! One item, each weekday, until the item is sold out. It sounds like sellouts happen pretty often. Today, there was a deal on a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse with Tilt Wheel and 27 AA batteries, for $21.99 including shipping. That is a good deal indeed.

Besides, woot! has always be a cool word and the FAQ is fun.
