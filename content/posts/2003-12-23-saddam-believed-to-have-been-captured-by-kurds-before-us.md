I&#8217;d imagine Bush will continue to get the credit for Saddam&#8217;s capture despite stuff like this in the press: [Yahoo! News &#8211; Saddam was held by Kurdish forces, drugged and left for US troops][1]

> &#8220;Saddam was not captured as a result of any American or British intelligence. We knew that someone would eventually take their revenge, it was just a matter of time.&#8221;
