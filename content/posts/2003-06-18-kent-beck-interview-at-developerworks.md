IBM DeveloperWorks gives us [Working smarter, not harder: An interview with Kent Beck][1]. It&#8217;s not a very long interview, but there are some decent quotes:

> So, simplicity is about acknowledging the tricks exist but not using them. Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if we could use the Java Security Manager here? Yeah we could, but let&#8217;s just put the name of the class. I used to feel proud of myself when I used something no one else knew about. Now I&#8217;m disappointed &#8212; I apologize when I can&#8217;t think of a simpler way.

Also of note: Beck said that he and Erich Gamma are working on a book about Eclipse.
