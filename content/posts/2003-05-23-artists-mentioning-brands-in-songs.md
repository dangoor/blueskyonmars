It&#8217;s not the best in terms of &#8220;artistic integrity&#8221;, but it sounds like some artists might be getting some pay for mentioning brands in their songs: [Yahoo! News &#8211; Bling! Bling! Ka-Ching! Pop Stars Cash In][1]. Sayeth the article:

> [Lil Kim&#8217;s] latest single, &#8220;The Jump Off,&#8221; scores the greatest number of brand mentions per song this year, with 14 different references, according to a company that tracks such information.
