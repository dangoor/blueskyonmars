This year has seemed like a big year for Python conference activity in the US. Of course, there was PyCon in March, which topped 1,000 attendees. I&#8217;ve also seen announcements for a bunch of regional Python gatherings (like PyOhio, which was close by but I couldn&#8217;t attend).

This year, we also get [PyWorks][1], which is joined at the hip with php|works in Atlanta in November. This is the first year for PyWorks, and they&#8217;ve got a good lineup going. There&#8217;s a day of tutorials and two days of talks, so this is more like a PyCon than it is like those regional conferences.

In addition to attending talks myself, I&#8217;m hoping to meet some more good Python and/or JavaScript folks in the &#8220;hallway track&#8221;. I&#8217;m sure there will be lots of Dojo users mixed in with the Python and PHP people, so we should get together.

I have four speaking slots (one of which isn&#8217;t listed yet) over the two conference days (gadzooks!). I&#8217;ll be doing a revised and expanded version of my PyCon talk &#8220;Rich Client Web Applications with TurboGears 2 and Dojo&#8221;. I&#8217;ll also be giving an updated version of the &#8220;Easy build and deployment automation with Paver&#8221; talk that Mark Ramm gave in my stead at PyOhio. Paver really puts the &#8220;scripting&#8221; back in &#8220;Python scripting language&#8221; (Python certainly does a lot more than &#8220;scripting&#8221;!)

I&#8217;ll also be giving a talk called &#8220;ZODB: The Most Underappreciated Library in Python&#8221;. The ZODB is great. More people should use it. This is a talk I gave a couple months back at MichiPUG, so it&#8217;s only been seen by a small group at this point.

My fourth talk is one I haven&#8217;t given anywhere before: &#8220;Beyond the Source: Growing Your Community&#8221;. I&#8217;m going to talk in concrete terms about things you can do to grow an open source community. Open source projects really need to get to a certain level of use before they become viable open source projects, and there are many, many ways in which people interested in a project can help it get there.

I hope to see you there!
