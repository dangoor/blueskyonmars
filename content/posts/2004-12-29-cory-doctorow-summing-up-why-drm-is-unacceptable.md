[Cory responds to Wired Editor on DRM][1] makes me want to go back to buying my music on AllOfMP3. I&#8217;ve been buying music on iTMS lately, because I have a gift certificate. Once that runs out, though, I&#8217;ll head back over and get my nice MP3 files.

Cory is absolutely right, though. The only reason I&#8217;ve been buying from iTMS is because I _know_ that I can ultimately have the songs in a usable form no matter what Apple works out with the labels. I still have a copy of Hymn that I haven&#8217;t tried out yet.
