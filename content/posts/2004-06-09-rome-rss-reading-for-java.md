Tim Bray points to [rome: All feeds lead to Rome][1], which is a (you guessed it) RSS/Atom feed parser for Java. They list the version as 0.1. I&#8217;m not sure how this would compare with [Informa][2] which includes goodies like Lucene searching and Hibernate storage.

Update: Sam Newman posted a [brief article][3] about this with an interesting point about Informa&#8217;s ease of use.
