I don&#8217;t have any Android devices at present, but I am sometimes curious about various things going on with Android. For example, it would be nice to be able to try out the [Khan Academy app for Android][1]. [Remix OS][2] is a way to run Android (with a desktop-like UI) on various Intel-based computers. People have had some success getting it to work on Macs and here are instructions [for creating the disk on the Mac][3].

_Update: _dizzyviolet on Hacker News [notes that the EULA for Remix OS][4] is crazytown.
