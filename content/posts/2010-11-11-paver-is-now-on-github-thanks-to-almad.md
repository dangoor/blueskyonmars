[Paver][1], the project scripting tool for Python, has just moved to GitHub thanks to [Almad][2]. Almad has stepped forward and offered to properly bring Paver into the second decade of the 21st century (doesn&#8217;t have the same ring to it as bringing something into the 21st century, does it? ðŸ™‚

Seriously, though, Paver reached the point where it was good enough for me and did what I wanted (and, apparently, a good number of other people wanted as well). Almad has some thoughts and where the project should go next and I&#8217;m looking forward to hearing more about them. [Sign up for the googlegroup][3] to see where Paver is going next.
