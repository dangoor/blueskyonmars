The [CoreCrib Blog][1] talks about buying parts to build your own expandable Mac for considerably less than what Apple charges for a similarly expandable Mac. I tell you, Mac OS X is very tempting to me. It seems like a great OS&#8230; it&#8217;s just a shame that the hardware is so expensive. (Compare this writer&#8217;s $775 with what you can get for $350 in the PC world&#8230;)
