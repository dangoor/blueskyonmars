Though it&#8217;s been on the schedule for a couple of weeks, Elizabeth Naramore has officially announced that I will be giving the opening keynote at the first PyWorks conference (I&#8217;m not sure how many years php|works has been going). This is a cool, combined conference, and I wanted to pick a topic that I think is fun and will be useful to both Python users and PHP users.

If you&#8217;re looking for screenfuls of code, this is not the talk for you (my other three talks are more code-filled). But this is going to be a very practical talk filled with things you can do right now to bring more people into your open source projects.
