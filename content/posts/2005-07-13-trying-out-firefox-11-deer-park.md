Since I&#8217;m primarily a Mac user these days, I was interested to learn that [Firefox 1.1 has improved the user experience][1] for Macs. Things like middle-clicking to open a link in a tab and making the preferences work more like Mac preferences do. So far, after a short time using it, Deer Park seems mighty fast. It also supports interesting things like CSS3 columns. Of course, you can&#8217;t use them because no one else in the world is running a browser that supports it, but it&#8217;s nice to see the standards support growing. 

Deer Park is an alpha, though, so we&#8217;ll see if I end up running into stability problems. If I do, Firefox 1.0.5 is out and that reportedly includes stability fixes and whatnot.
