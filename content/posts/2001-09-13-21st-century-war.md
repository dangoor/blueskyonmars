Jon Carrol [Welcome to the 21st Century][1]: _&#8220;There will be pressure to suspend our freedoms, to allow the government to invade our privacy and control our speech as part of the glossy new war. If terrorists force America to give up its freedoms, then they will have won.&#8221;_ Good article. He also talks about how in this war, we don&#8217;t know who we&#8217;re fighting.
