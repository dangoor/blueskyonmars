Philip Greenspun wrote a thought provoking small article about [Outlining and the presidential campaign][1] which advocates using online weblogs and outlines to track what a presidential candidate says. There are bound to be ways to make this happen, even beyond what Greenspun suggests. In &#8217;92, I remember disliking Clinton because he seemed to change his stance at every campaign stop. With enough communication, it will be impossible for a candidate to keep changing their platform and not get caught.
