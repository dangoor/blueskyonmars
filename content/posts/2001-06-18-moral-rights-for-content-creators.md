[Smart Tags and the Microsoft Problem Revisited][1]: _&#8220;Moral rights are a package of intellectual property rights granted to the original creator of a work, and include:</p> 

  * The right of integrity; 
      * The right of attribution; 
          * The right of disclosure; 
              * The right to withdraw or retract; 
                  * The right to reply to criticism.</ul> 
                    &#8220;</i> Michael Fraase says in his article that these rights are actually written into law in many countries.

                    I&#8217;m all in favor of an increased awareness of what makes sense as the rights of a creator and what makes sense for intellectual property holders. (I think there should be more of the former and less of the latter.)
