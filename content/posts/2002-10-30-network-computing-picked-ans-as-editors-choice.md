From December 1994 to March 1999, I worked for ANS Communications (which was independent, then part of AOL, then part of WorldCom while I was there). I just received a link to [a Network Computing review of ISPs][1] that picked ANS as Editor&#8217;s Choice and talked about how great the ANS NOC was. I&#8217;ve got very fond memories of working in that NOC, and it&#8217;s great to see how people in the outside world perceived it.
