Jim McDonald of our local Python Users Group (MichiPUG) created the [Python Web Developer Appliance][1], which is a VMWare Player appliance for trying out almost everything you could want related to Python web development. It&#8217;s all configured and ready to run. It&#8217;s a slick piece of work if you&#8217;re looking to tinker.
