I came across [Nice][1] a few months ago, but continued on my way. I&#8217;m not one to get into fringe languages and Nice seemed a bit academic. Xoltar&#8217;s [Groovy features in Nice][2] made me look again at the Nice site, and there are some interesting features there. Multiple return values is something that is sorely missing from Java, and I&#8217;d like to see that in Groovy. Syntax for optional method parameters would be a bonus, and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s something in Groovy yet either.

A little friendly competition never hurt anyone. Nice even has an Eclipse plugin as well, so it looks like the Nice 1.0 package may actually be worth considering for high-level programming needs.
