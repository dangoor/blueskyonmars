An idea that I had at PyCon has finally come to fruition: introducing [Psychotic][1], a pure Python optimizing compiler that achieves some pretty impressive results.

For a new project, Psychotic has a good deal of documentation. There&#8217;s also the [introductory screencas][2]t, which is &#8220;lightning talk sized&#8221; (under 5 minutes).

There&#8217;s actually a [fuller announcement][3] over at the SitePen blog.
