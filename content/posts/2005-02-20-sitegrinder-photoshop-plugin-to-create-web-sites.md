Nearly all people in the design world use Photoshop in some capacity or another. It&#8217;s not uncommon for web site designs to begin in Photoshop and then get &#8220;cut up&#8221; into working web pages. [SiteGrinder][1] provides a way to automatically turn a Photoshop design into web pages by using hints that you give in your layer names. Nice idea, but I&#8217;d have to try it to know for sure. On the plus side, it does seem to be modern web friendly (XHTML, CSS).
