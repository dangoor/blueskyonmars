Having used a few different PC-based music tools, Wired&#8217;s [The Incredible Shrinking Studio][1] article is not too surprising:

> &#8220;You can take your laptop and work almost anywhere and use it to make incredible music on stage,&#8221; [Berklee Professor Michael Bierylo] said. &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty revolutionary. The whole idea of the studio as a single place where all the production is done has more or less flown out the window. High-end studios still have their place, of course, but more and more and more musicians are tracking in different locations.&#8221;

Interesting bits about who&#8217;s doing their music portably.

Of course, making music still takes work and talent. The difference is that now it doesn&#8217;t take a $250,000 budget.
