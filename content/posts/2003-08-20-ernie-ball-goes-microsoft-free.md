Ever since the BSA raided made an example of Ernie Ball (the guitar string maker), [they&#8217;ve gone Microsoft-free][1]. Sterling Ball, the CEO, says that they&#8217;re a real-life example of a company successfully using open source and that analyst estimates of the cost are too high:

> What support? I&#8217;m not making calls to Red Hat; I don&#8217;t need to. I think that&#8217;s propaganda&#8230;What about the cost of dealing with a virus? We don&#8217;t have &#8217;em. How about when we do have a problem, you don&#8217;t have to send some guy to a corner of the building to find out what&#8217;s going on&#8211;he never leaves his desk, because everything&#8217;s server-based. There&#8217;s no doubt that what I&#8217;m doing is cheaper to operate. The analyst guys can say whatever they want.

Organizations that don&#8217;t treat their customers with respect or provide quality product at a fair price will always lose out in the end.
