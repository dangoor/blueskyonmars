The Bill of Rights was created to protect people from the corruption that comes from a government with absolute power (absolute power corrupts absolutely, as they say). I don&#8217;t think the founding fathers anticipated that the Bill of Rights would be needed to protect against [the &#8220;entertainment industry&#8221;][1]. The story is that in Delhi, India, the international arm of the Motion Picture Association has been granted a general warrants that &#8220;[permit] police to search any premises suspected of containing pirated products, and permits officers to open locked premises without delay.&#8221; So, if you live in Delhi, Joe Moviemaker can get the police to come storming into your house practically on a whim.

Aren&#8217;t you glad we have the 4th Amendment?
