[FactCheck.org &#8211; Annenberg Political Fact Check][1] is a non-partisan fact checking group (apparently out of U of Pennsylvania) that attempts to correct errors that come up during political speeches and commercials. This looks like a good site to watch during this election, as both Bush and Dean have been shown to have interesting interpretations of the facts along the way.
