There&#8217;s the old question &#8220;if a tree falls and no one hears it, did it make a noise?&#8221; Just as goofy: &#8220;if you improve the performance of an unreleased application, did it actually get faster?&#8221;

I&#8217;m definitely in the &#8220;premature optimization is the root of all evil&#8221; camp, but the time has come for some performance work on Zesty News. I currently have well over 1,000 unread items, and it takes a few seconds to bring up the main view. Fixing this does make the code more complex, which is why I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t do it prematurely But, now is the time. So, _I&#8217;ll_ see the performance difference. Zesty&#8217;s alpha testers won&#8217;t even be aware that it used to take a few seconds. (And that&#8217;s the way it should be.)
