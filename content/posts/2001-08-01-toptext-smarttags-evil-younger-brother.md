SmartTags are already indirectly infiltrating PCs, and not because of Microsoft. People who installed KaZaA on their systems will start seeing yellow links on pages&#8230; [Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters][1]: _&#8220;this is because a cunning piece of software called TopText was automatically installed on your computer along with KaZaA.&#8221;_ Ack. If those links are all essentially ads, this does no good for the consumer and is worse than SmartTags.
