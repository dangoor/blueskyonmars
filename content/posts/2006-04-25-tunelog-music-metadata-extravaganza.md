The good folks of Frozen Bear bring us [tunelog][1] which gives you all kinds of social web 2.0 music metadata madness. It&#8217;s got a complete, _documented_ API and can keep track of what you listen to in iTunes on Windows or Pandora, if you wish. They&#8217;re making good use of TurboGears, as the API supports both XML and JSON output.
