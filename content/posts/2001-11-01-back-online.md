Yes, I realize that the current look of the site is a bit strange, but after a week and a half without a blog, I was dying to get the site back up. So, here it is&#8230; now powered by [Drupal][1], which will allow me to do more cool things and will produce decent RSS.
  
So, thanks for sticking with me and coming back to read.
