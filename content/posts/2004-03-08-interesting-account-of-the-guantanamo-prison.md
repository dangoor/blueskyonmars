&#8220;[Cuba? It was great, say boys freed from US prison camp][1]&#8221; gives the account of three boys who were captured in Afghanstan and recently released. They certainly paint a rosy picture of Guantanamo for the people worried about the treatment of the prisoners there. I was never really concerned about the prisoners there being tortured or mistreated. My thought has been that they have been detained for years without representation.
