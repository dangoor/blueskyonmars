The headline talks about [Google pair make billionaire row][1], referring to Larry Page and Sergey Brin, each estimated at $1 billion. I found it more interesting to see that JK Rowling, author of the _Harry Potter_ series, has become a billionaire. That&#8217;s pretty dramatic for someone who writes books to have generated that kind of money in the 21st century.
