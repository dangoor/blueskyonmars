We&#8217;ve settled on a topic for the coming [Michigan Python Users Group][1] meeting: [Google App Engine][2]. We do not have a speaker, so this will be a combination of discussion and exploration. I have written some App Engine code, and I&#8217;m guessing that others that will be attending have, too, so it&#8217;s not all trial-and-error.

Following our usual formal (first Thursday of the month), the meeting will be on June 5th at 7PM at [SRT Solutions][3] in downtown Ann Arbor. There are parking structures nearby (4th and Washington and Liberty Square are both close), and there is usually free street parking on Ann Street near the police station.

See you there!
