At the next [Michigan Python Users Group (MichiPUG)][1] meeting, we&#8217;ll be talking about building custom web frameworks using WSGI bits and pieces. I&#8217;ve done this a couple of times now and think it&#8217;s a powerful and straightforward approach that works well for certain kinds of projects.

I&#8217;m figuring we&#8217;ll take a look at some available components and glue stuff together to build a framework during the session.

As usual, the meeting is the first Thursday of the month (February 5th, in this case) at 7pm at the [SRT Solutions][2] office in downtown Ann Arbor.
