In the last of three articles about the state of online music, [CNET explores free (Kazaa) and paid online music services (Apple iTunes Music Store)][1]. I absolutely disagree with this statement:

> Rather than fear their demise, free music services say the large music companies and e-tailers will have no choice but to work with file-swapping technology instead of against it.

The most successful paid online music service, iTunes, does not &#8220;work with file-swapping technology&#8221;. The P2P companies want to ensure that they have a part in the future of online music, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s guaranteed. iTunes is successful because it&#8217;s easy and it&#8217;s faster than P2P, because you&#8217;re not downloading from someone&#8217;s home cable connection. Or worse, downloading from someone&#8217;s _modem_.

Michael Robertson, former CEO of MP3.com has it right:

> &#8220;The majority of people will say, &#8216;I&#8217;ll just steal because then I get to use it the way I want to.&#8221;

Exactly. Even iTunes seems a bit restrictive to me, but people are still downloading millions of songs despite the fact that the service only works on Macs.
