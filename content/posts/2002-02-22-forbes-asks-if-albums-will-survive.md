Not surprisingly, [this Forbes article][1] has people on both sides of the fence as to whether albums &#8211; collections of songs &#8211; will be replaced by single songs in the digital age. In my opinion, the majority of albums that are released are merely collections of single songs. Yes, that collection of songs does reflect where the artist was at one point in time. But, timestamped singles would do the same thing. Only a few albums really try to tie the songs together into a cohesive whole.
