The August MichiPUG meeting will be held at the Google Ann Arbor office. We&#8217;re having a joint meeting with the Ann Arbor Computer Society: [Google Ann Arbor Tech Talk Event][1].

The meeting is at the normal MichiPUG time (presentation starts at 7PM on Thursday, August 2nd). However, there&#8217;s going to be food, drinks and chatting with area tech folks and Google folks starting at 6PM. We&#8217;re looking forward to an excellent gathering. Space is limited so [be sure to RSVP][1].
