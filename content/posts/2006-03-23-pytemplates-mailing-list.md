TurboGears has an interface for template engines that now supports quite a few template tools and CherryPy and Pylons as hosts for those templates. It&#8217;s quite simple to work with, but there are still a couple of things that need to be done to it. Since there are a few people involved on both sides (template plugins and plugin users), I thought it practical to set up a mailing list to finish hashing out interface changes and get them out there.

If you&#8217;re into that kind of thing, here&#8217;s the group: [pytemplates][1]
