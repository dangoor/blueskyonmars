This year was the first [CodeMash][1] conference, and I hope it&#8217;s not the last. Unfortunately, I could only stay for one of the two conference days.

What makes CodeMash great is that it&#8217;s a software developer conference that covers all the bases. There were lots of Python talks. There were .NET people all about. Lots of Ruby love. Many Java folks. (There were many well known folks there as well.) It was a great theme for a conference and it was really nice to have it in the midwest.

The organizers did an excellent job. From a speaker/attendee&#8217;s perspective, everything seemed very smooth. The Kalahari hotel (and indoor waterpark) was very nice, and I&#8217;m only disappointed that I didn&#8217;t have a chance to go into the waterpark while I was there.
