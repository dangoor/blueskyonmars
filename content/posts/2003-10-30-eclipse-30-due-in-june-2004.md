The [Eclipse Project Draft 3.0 Plan][1] has been updated and now shows milestones up through M9 with final 3.0 release in June 2004. Unfortunately, it doesn&#8217;t look like anything else has been updated to show what is in the Nov 21 M5 release. I really want the J2SE 1.5 features, but those are still under &#8220;proposed items&#8221;. There is [some code][2] that may make it into M5 that provides some of the backend stuff (AST) support for generics. But, as the bug linked says, there&#8217;s a bunch of other work yet to be done.

I don&#8217;t think giving up generics is worth switching from Eclipse to javac.
