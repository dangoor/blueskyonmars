Found on Slashdot, here is one developer&#8217;s tale of [bringing down a copycat site][1]. It is very hard to protect intellectual property on the net. While I think that open source is great, I also think that no viable business model for open source consumer desktop software has yet appeared. Until we can figure out a good model, we have to deal with IP violations.
