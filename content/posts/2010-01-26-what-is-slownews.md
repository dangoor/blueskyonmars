The move toward real-time everything is _wrong_. We have enough interruptions in our days without having random links and news sprayed at us 24&#215;7. Not to mention that there&#8217;s no real thought that goes into real time, and generally very little thought that gets compressed into 140 characters. Length also does not guarantee quality, and too much text can be a waste of time. The trick is to be concise.

I&#8217;ve adopted my SlowNews newsletter-like format for sharing and commenting on what&#8217;s going on in the software world. A weekly post for software developers and technically minded product managers. This is a way to keep up with interesting things that are happening, but through the lens of a weekly view where the uninteresting is edited away, the more interesting is promoted to the top and a bit of commentary ties it all together.

SlowNews is a chance for me to gather my thoughts and to review the truly interesting things that are going on in software product creation.

Blue Sky On Mars SlowNews is published on **Tuesday mornings at 9am Eastern time**.
