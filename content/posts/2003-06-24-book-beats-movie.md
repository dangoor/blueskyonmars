What was the biggest thing in entertainment this past weekend? Could it be the long-anticipated, quite hyped _Hulk_? _Hulk_ grossed more than $62 million to have the biggest June movie opening to date. But, this weekend, _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_ debuted in bookstores around the world. Scholastic reports that it sold 5 million copies on Saturday (including preorders). Even with the common 40% discount, that still marks a $90 million debut! This is probably the first weekend that a book has outgrossed a big, new movie release!
