[SiliconValley.com &#8211; Dan Gillmor&#8217;s eJournal][1]: _&#8220;We&#8217;re not against the GPL, Mundie said today. All Microsoft wants is for people to understand the issues, and then make informed choices.&#8221;_ Gillmor&#8217;s coverage of this is pretty interesting. Maybe the open source advocates will learn a thing or two about taking a reasonable, balanced approach to debate.
