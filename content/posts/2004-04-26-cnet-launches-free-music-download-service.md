[CNET launches free music downloads][1]:

> &#8220;We are the first large-scale provider to offer free music downloads in a discover-focused environment, saving music fans valuable time in finding tunes that match their tastes,&#8221; said Scot Arpajian, senior vice president of CNET Download.com.

Here is yet another avenue for unsigned artists to get some exposure. MP3.com wasn&#8217;t able to stay in business with this model, but hopefully CNET can keep this going.
