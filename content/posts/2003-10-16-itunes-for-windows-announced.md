From [MacRumors&#8217;][1] live coverage of Apple&#8217;s music event today, they are reporting that Apple has announced iTunes for Windows. Steve Jobs said that Apple current has 70% of the downloaded music market, and have raised the bar on the number of downloads they expect.

> Now, we are clearly the market leader here. We set some goals. We wanted to sell 1 million in the first 6 months, but sold 1 million in the first week. Reset goal to 10 milllion in 6 months, but reached it in 4 months. Now&#8230; want to sell 100 million songs in a year &#8211; by April 2004.

To get there, they&#8217;ve announced an exclusive deal with AOL that will put iTunes links all over the AOL music site. They&#8217;ve also got a big Superbowl promotion going with Pepsi, where 1 in 3 Pepsi bottles is a winner of a free iTunes song.

Apple&#8217;s marketing fu is staggering. This launch really makes the original launches of Pressplay and MusicNet look like the jokes that they were.

Apple also announced new iPod peripherals: digicam storage and a microphone. These do not particularly excite me&#8230; but you can tell from the event that these were not the big announcement. Apple is expecting big things from iTunes for Windows&#8230; $100 million in first year revenue from songs, plus mega sales of iPods to follow.
