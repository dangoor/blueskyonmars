I generally don&#8217;t run antivirus software, because I&#8217;m not a likely target. I use up-to-date software and am careful about what I download and install. That said, there are plenty of people for whom antivirus software is important. It&#8217;s great to see: [ClamWin Antivirus. A Free Open Source (GPL) Virus Scanner for Windows.][1] This always seemed to me like the kind of thing that would work well as open source. Once you get the basic software put together (a non-trivial task, to be sure), updating the definitions is not quite so hard. There are plenty of security folks out there who follow these things, and I&#8217;m sure many of them would love to have the power to help stop viruses ASAP. Here&#8217;s that chance!
