I&#8217;m keeping a bookmark of [Nicolas Lehuen&#8217;s pytst ternary search tree][1] library. I don&#8217;t need one right this second, but TST&#8217;s are very useful (look at Nicolas&#8217; description to see why). It&#8217;s LGPL open source, written in C++. If I do find myself needing a TST, I&#8217;m likely to also need to use it with Unicode, which this one does not currently support. I&#8217;d have to figure that out when I get there&#8230;
