Probably the #1 reason that I&#8217;ve been using Firefox instead of Safari has been the lack of &#8220;type ahead find&#8221; aka &#8220;find as you type&#8221; aka &#8220;that thing where you start typing and it searches the page without having to pop up a window, so it&#8217;s like really convenient and you can just press enter to follow a link so it&#8217;s good for navigation too&#8221;. [Acid Search][1] brings that feature to Safari and adds the ability to really expand Safari&#8217;s search box. It&#8217;s worth noting that [Saft][2], the uber-Safari plugin, adds type ahead find as well.

Another Safari tip that I just learned that will make life so much nicer is that pressing the option/alt key while tabbing through form fields allows you to get to every control, including buttons and combo boxes. It&#8217;s always been really annoying to have to reach for the mouse when I hit the &#8220;State&#8221; field on a form.
