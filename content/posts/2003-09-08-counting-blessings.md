Hard to believe that Crysania is already more than 6 weeks old! She&#8217;s doing great (already up to 9 pounds, from her low of 6 pounds 3 ounces!). Surekha had her 6 week physical and is also doing great!

Sure, sleep isn&#8217;t quite as restful and Crysania keeps us busy, but there is so much to be thankful for. And each little coo and smile that she gives is a great present. Parenting is everything people say it is, and it&#8217;s great! Just be sure you do it when you&#8217;re ready for it!
