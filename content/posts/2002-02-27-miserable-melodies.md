Who can live without a site devoted to Miserable Melodies. Timeless anticlassics, just waiting to make you hurl. Listening to this will make you think more highly of tonight&#8217;s Grammy nominees.

Update: As pointed out in the comments, this site has moved on sometime over the five years since I posted this.
