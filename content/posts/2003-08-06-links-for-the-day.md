I&#8217;m playing catch-up in my aggregator after two weeks away. I&#8217;m sure that plenty of interesting things from last week have dropped off the radar, and that&#8217;s okay. If they&#8217;re really, really interesting they&#8217;ll pop back up sometime.

Tim Bray has put together a table of contents for his [excellent series on search engine technology][1].

[Apache Geronimo][2] is being incubated as a new J2EE container. Sure, competition is good, but I am led to wonder if time would be better spent improving [other open source projects][3].

Red Hat has [sued][4] SCO to stop the FUD, while SCO announces insane pricing for Linux server licenses.
