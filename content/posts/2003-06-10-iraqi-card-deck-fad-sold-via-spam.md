The NY Times chronicles how [the Iraqi card deck was successfully sold via spam][1].

> Hundreds of millions of e-mail messages about the cards have been sent since, and some 1.5 million decks have been sold by GreatUSAflags.com

C&#8217;mon, folks! It&#8217;s stories like this that explain why I get so much spam! If people would just refuse to buy goods from spammers, these marketing campaigns wouldn&#8217;t work.
