Apparently, the [White House is set to project record deficits][1]:

> The White House was expected on Tuesday to forecast a record budget deficit approaching a half trillion dollars this fiscal year &#8212; $150 billion worse than its earlier projections &#8212; with little hope of a turnaround any time soon.

This is just plain awful fiscal management. Not only is it incredible that a tax cut was issued with a projected $300 billion deficit, but now we see &#8220;oops! our forecast was off by 50%&#8221;. Sure, there&#8217;s new money being spent on Iraq and such ($58 billion between Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the article), but there&#8217;s still another $100 billion that was unprojected.

In the private sector, a CEO (or at least the CFO) would be fired for something like that.
