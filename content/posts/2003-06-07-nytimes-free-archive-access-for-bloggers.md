Interesting. Dave Winer has worked out an arrangement with the NY Times that ensures that appropriately formatted archive links [will continue to work free of charge][1], despite their policy of charging for articles after 7 days.

> The special coding tells the Times&#8217;s server that the link is coming from a weblog, and now and in the future, this link will work without a fee to access the archive.

That&#8217;s impressive that the Times is really that serious about wanting people to comment on and link to their stories.
