At long last, the first half of [Rapid Web Applications with TurboGears][1] is now available electronically as part of &#8220;Rough Cuts&#8221;. You can buy it electronically now and keep getting updates all the way through the final copy of the book. The book is entirely in the editing phase right now and we&#8217;re working hard to wrap it all up quickly. We&#8217;re expecting the entire book to be on Safari by the end of the month, and it should be available in print next month.
