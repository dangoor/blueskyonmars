[Joyent Slingshot][1] uses Ruby on Rails to create webapps that you run on your desktop that can sync up with the server side. It&#8217;s designed to provide an easily installable program for Windows and Mac. This is a good idea and it&#8217;s good timing for this product, because it&#8217;s coming out head-to-head against Adobe&#8217;s Apollo. Apollo could be huge, but it&#8217;s just getting going.

For those who have been following my blog, TurboGears was actually extracted from a desktop webapp. I didn&#8217;t have a need for the sync part of the equation, but I did indeed create an easy way for me to build Windows and Mac double-clickable apps (with little bits of platform-specific GUI to make it nice).

Good luck to Joyent with the new product! Spiffy stuff!
