Parentstages talks about [offbeat kids music][1]. Looking at their selections, it looks like they may be talking about music that I can actually stand, as opposed to some of the stuff you see on TV. Those commercials for CDs that have a bunch of kids singing nursery rhymes make me want to gag. They&#8217;ve got _real kids_ singing those nursery rhymes, so they&#8217;re way off pitch. Call me a snob if you will, but I don&#8217;t want a CD like that. Live school musicals are one thing, but a prerecorded CD should at least be on pitch.
