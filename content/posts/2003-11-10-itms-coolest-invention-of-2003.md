Time Magazine has named [the Apple ITunes Music Store][1] the &#8220;Coolest Invention of 2003&#8221;. Its release was definitely a landmark occurence in the online music biz. However, if Dean Kamen&#8217;s [water purifier][2] works as described, that sounds like a much bigger deal. Ten gallons of clean water an hour, without much power consumption, from a $1000 device. _That&#8217;s_ impressive.
