Chet Haase has provided very detailed information on strategies for loading images in Java and acheiving good display performance: [java.net: ToolkitBufferedVolatileManagedImage Strategies][1]. We&#8217;re doing quite a bit of image work (with 600 dpi 8.5&#8243;x11&#8243; images), so I&#8217;ve already become acquainted with Java 1.4 ImageIO and JDK 1.2 BufferedImage. Most recently, I&#8217;ve been looking at the operation chaining features of Java Advanced Imaging in an attempt to quickly provide high-quality screen resolution scalings of those 600 dpi images. Too bad we can&#8217;t just get 600 dpi screens ðŸ™‚
