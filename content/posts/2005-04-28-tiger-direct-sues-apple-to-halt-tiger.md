Tiger Direct appears to be shameless. One day before the slated release of Mac OS X Tiger, they have decided that [Apple is infringing on their trademark][1]. The claim does indeed have merit, but the timing certainly doesn&#8217;t. The Mac OS X Tiger name was announced a long time ago, and I&#8217;m sure that Tiger Direct had heard of it before this week.

They&#8217;re just hoping for a cushy settlement, given Apple&#8217;s billions in cash.
