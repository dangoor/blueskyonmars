Go get it, if you can! It doesn&#8217;t look like the mirrors have it yet. Check out the [Eclipse 3.0 M7 News][1] for all the detail. Here are the things that interest me:

  * Export Standalone Mac OS X apps &#8211; very nifty, if you&#8217;re a Mac person
  * Content Assist in dialog boxes &#8211; which fixes something that&#8217;s always bugged me a little&#8230; specifically, the New Class dialog box that they show. It always bothered me that I had to click &#8220;Browse&#8221; when I&#8217;ve already typed in the name of the class I want.
  * Improved string compare in JUnit &#8211; it diffs the strings!
  * File system changes can be automatically refreshed
  * The package explorer finally has the ability to run classes from the context menu.
  * A bunch of useful Ant improvements that make the upgrade worthwhile by themselves (if you use ant

All this, plus there&#8217;s the rumored support of 2.1 plugins. It looks like a great update&#8230; now if only they&#8217;d add the J2SE 1.5 support ðŸ™‚
