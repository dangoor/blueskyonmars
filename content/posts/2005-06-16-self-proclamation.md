I&#8217;ve seen Michael Jackson referred to as the &#8220;self-proclaimed King of Pop&#8221;. I&#8217;m not entirely certain about whether the King of Pop moniker was actually self-proclaimed to begin with (and I&#8217;m too lazy to even do a Google search to find out, given that it&#8217;s not my main point). My point is that Richard MacManus has declared himself the [self-proclaimed][1] Father of Web 2.0. (Note my link text.) I think it would be cool to see Richard MacManus take over &#8220;self-proclaimed&#8221;, in addition to &#8220;Father of Web 2.0&#8221;, which he has apparently already gathered on Google.

As for me, I&#8217;d settle for being the King of Self-Proclamation.
