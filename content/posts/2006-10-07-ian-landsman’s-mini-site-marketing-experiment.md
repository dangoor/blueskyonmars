[Ian Landsmanâ€™s Mini Site Marketing Experiment][1] is one of the best marketing ideas (and implementations thereof) that I&#8217;ve seen in quite a while. Check out the [Open Source Help Desk List][2] site that he created. This is a genuinely useful roundup of open source help desk software, though the alphabetical listing is not as useful as listings by platform or by relative maturity/usability would be. The site is not so subtly trying to get people to consider Ian&#8217;s HelpSpot product as an alternative. You know what? There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that. The resource he&#8217;s created is useful and highlights one segment of his competition. It seems likely that people perusing his list will check out HelpSpot and, assuming they&#8217;re willing to pay at all, may indeed pony up the reasonable price for it.

Good job, Ian!
