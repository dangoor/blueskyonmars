[Oprius][1] has just updated their website and opened up signups. Their first offering is Oprius Foundations, which is a free, integrated contacts, calendar and todo management app. It&#8217;s very slick, Ajaxy goodness can be seen in their screencast. This is a stepping stone to their actual bread-and-butter product: Oprius Independent. Independent is software to help people who are independent direct sales and network sales business people.

It&#8217;s also worth noting that Oprius is [hiring][2].
