The [Michigan Python Users Group (MichiPUG)][1] monthly meeting is coming up this Thursday, July 3rd at 7PM. This month, I&#8217;ll be speaking about the [Zope Object Database (ZODB)][2]. Unlike last month&#8217;s meeting, where I led us in a random experiment with Google App Engine, I actually have [some][3] [experience][4] with the ZODB.

I&#8217;ll be demonstrating use of the ZODB and will talk about concurrency, replication, packing, etc. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the ZODB (and you&#8217;re somewhere near Ann Arbor!), this is a useful topic to get to know, because the ZODB is great for a variety of situations.

**Update (May 13, 2009)**: You can see my [examples][5] from this talk.
