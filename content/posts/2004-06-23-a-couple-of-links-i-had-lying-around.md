I&#8217;ve had these browser windows open for a couple of days and figured I would drop the links in here. Carlos Perez writes up [Manageability &#8211; Nuggets of Wisdom from eBay&#8217;s Architecture][1], which summarizes a presentation on how eBay has achieved scalability. Interesting stuff.

Christian Bauer writes about [using triggers to store the history of an object][2] and points to the Hibernate wiki which includes a [Hibernate Interceptor implementation of a history logger][3].
