I just noticed an interesting new feature on Froogle: [Froogle Shopping List][1]. Froogle recognized my gmail account and allowed me to easily set up a Froogle account to store my shopping list. The feature itself is not that exciting (Amazon has certainly been doing this for a while). But, I do find it interesting that Google is starting to sneak out more personalized services.
