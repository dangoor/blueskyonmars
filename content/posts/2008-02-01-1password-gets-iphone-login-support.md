Taking advantage of the fact that bookmarklets can be just about any length, the new version of [1Password][1] can now fill in forms with your login information <span style="font-style: italic;">on your iPhone</span>. This is in addition to 1Password&#8217;s previous mechanism for passing along your 1Password data in a secure bookmarklet.

For the security minded out there, 1Password stores your passwords in encrypted form in the bookmarklet. The decryption code is written in JavaScript that runs on the phone and you have to type in an access code that you set up. Unless someone has your access code, they won&#8217;t be able to use your stored passwords.

Over the past 3 weeks, 1Password has potentially picked up about 44,000 new users from MacHeist. For those of you with iPhones, go check out this update!
