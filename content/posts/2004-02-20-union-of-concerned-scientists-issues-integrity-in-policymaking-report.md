Sixty scientists, including twenty Nobel laureates, believe that [Bush distorts science][1]:

> The Union of Concerned Scientists, an independent organization, also issued a 37-page report, &#8220;Scientific Integrity in Policymaking,&#8221; detailing the accusations. The statement and the report both accuse the Bush administration of distorting and suppressing findings that contradict administration policies, stacking panels with like-minded and underqualified scientists with ties to industry, and eliminating some advisory committees altogether.
