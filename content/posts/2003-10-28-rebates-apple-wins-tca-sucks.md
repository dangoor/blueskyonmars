Rebates on computer products often suck. I waited _a year_ to get a rebate on my Envision LCD monitor. TCA Fulfillment Services has conveniently lost not one, but two separate rebates for Computer Geeks products! TCA (who runs &#8220;wheresmyrebate.com&#8221;) has just denied a CompUSA rebate of mine, because they didn&#8217;t like the receipt I sent them. Beware, beware, beware!

On the flip side, there&#8217;s Apple. I had a far bigger rebate coming from them, and they got the check in my hands 3 weeks after I sent it in! That&#8217;s the way to process rebates.
  
**Update 1/19/05**: This posting appears to be one of my most viewed over time. For your convenience, TCA&#8217;s toll-free number is: 800-578-8883 (that way you don&#8217;t have to read through all of the comments to find that tidbit).
