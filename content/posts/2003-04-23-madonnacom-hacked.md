Personally, I don&#8217;t blame Madonna and Warner for planting decoys on the P2P networks. I find that to be a much more tasteful way to try to protect her copyrights than creating stupid laws. Additionally, I give Warner some credit for releasing the American Life single in MP3 form, even if they did charge too much ($1.50). But, someone disagreed with the decoy tactic [and expressed that opinion on Madonna&#8217;s own site][1]. That is a mildly amusing hack, though.
