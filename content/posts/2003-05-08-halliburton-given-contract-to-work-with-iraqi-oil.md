Oh, come on! [BBC NEWS | Halliburton&#8217;s Iraq role expands][1]. Thanks to Dave Winer for bringing it to my attention (and I&#8217;m sure that of many other people) that the company that VP Dick Cheney formerly ran was given a lucrative contract in Iraq without any competitive bidding.
  
According to the Guardian, Cheney was paid $1 million in &#8220;deferred compensation&#8221; from Halliburton in 2001. This money is apparently money he is owed from before he left Halliburton to become VP. One of Cheney&#8217;s aides said &#8220;Also, the vice president has nothing whatsoever to do with the Pentagon bidding process.&#8221; Err, yeah. Maybe not directly, but I&#8217;m sure he has influence. It&#8217;s not that the government can&#8217;t give contracts to Halliburton. It&#8217;s that they need to be very clean and up front and _publicly documented_ about how they do it!
