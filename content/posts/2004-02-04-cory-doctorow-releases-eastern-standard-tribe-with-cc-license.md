Cory Doctorow has just released [Eastern Standard Tribe][1], his second novel. His first, _Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom_ apparently sold very well and I seem to remember Entertainment Weekly naming it one of the best of 2003. The link above goes to Cory&#8217;s page where he talks about the future of publishing and why _Down and Out_ and </i>Eastern Standard Tribe</i> are out in CC licenses.

> The thing that&#8217;s extraordinary about that first novel is that it was released under terms governed by a Creative Commons license that allowed my readers to copy the book freely and distribute it far and wide. Hundreds of thousands of copies of the book were made and distributed this way. Hundreds of thousands.

That article is a really great read. It shows real vision.
