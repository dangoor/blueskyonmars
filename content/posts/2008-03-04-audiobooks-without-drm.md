What&#8217;s funny about the music industry and now the publishing industry taking these steps away from DRM is that <span style="font-style: italic;">this has all been done before</span>! You don&#8217;t need to look any further than what happened with copy protected software&#8230; and things that you really want to take with you (like music, audiobooks and now movies) are even more likely to suffer from the problems people disliked about copy protected software.

Music, now audiobooks and even many ebooks are going DRM-free. How long will it take for movies to do the same?
