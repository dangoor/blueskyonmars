My server for Blue Sky On Mars is running on Fedora Core 3. I&#8217;m not in a rush to upgrade to FC4, but I know that such an upgrade is inevitable. Since the server is remote, thousands of miles away from me, I&#8217;m interested in doing the upgrade via yum. Apparently, it can be done, but there are potential gotchas. Thankfully, those gotchas have been enumerated here: [YumUpgradeFaq][1].
