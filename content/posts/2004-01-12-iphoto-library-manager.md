The [iPhoto Library Manager][1] makes it easy to manage multiple iPhoto libraries. I&#8217;ve been thinking about this recently, because my iPhoto library is currently 750MB and will undoubtedly grow very quickly. My PowerBook only has a 40GB drive, so there&#8217;s only so much space for media directly on my machine. The ability to move older pictures into a separate, network-connected iPhoto library would be nice.
