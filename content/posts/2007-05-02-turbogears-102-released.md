Congrats to the TurboGears team for the new 1.0.2.2 release (see the [full changelog][1]). Though this release is a minor version number bump, it comes with a couple of nice, new features: Python 2.5 support and localizable errors messages in FormEncode. Special thanks for the Pyrex folks and Phillip Eby (author of RuleDispatch, among many other things) for making the Python 2.5 support possible.

There are, of course, a number of other changes and fixes from quite a few people (and the project has gained some new committers in the past few weeks). And kudos, of course, to Alberto for keeping the project moving forward.
