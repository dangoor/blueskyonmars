As promised when he released it, Seth Godin&#8217;s ebook [KnockKnock][1] is now available for free.

> It&#8217;s a short take on how to use the new online marketing tools to make any website work more effectively.

I haven&#8217;t read it yet, but I&#8217;ve [enjoyed Seth&#8217;s work in the past][2]. All of his books have at least one powerful idea that makes the read worthwhile.
