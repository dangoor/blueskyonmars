A [vulnerability][1] has been discovered in Microsoft&#8217;s Passport service which is absolutely crazy. Here&#8217;s a service that Microsoft is pitching for handling your security needs all over the net, and they leave such a glaring hole there. What&#8217;s worse, the reporter said that they discovered the problem on April 12th and could not get a response from Microsoft.
