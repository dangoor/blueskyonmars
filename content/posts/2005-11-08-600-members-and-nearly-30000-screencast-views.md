I&#8217;ve been really busy these past few days, working on features for TurboGears 0.9 and creating a new screencast. This morning a took a quick look at the stats. The [TurboGears google group][1] has passed 600 members and the &#8220;20 Minute Wiki&#8221; is likely to pass 30,000 views this week. It&#8217;s also likely that TurboGears.org will serve its 40,000th Python Egg this week!
