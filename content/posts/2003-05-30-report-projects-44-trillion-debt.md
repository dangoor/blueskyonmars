According to the [Financial Times][1],

> The Bush administration has shelved a report commissioned by the Treasury that shows the US currently faces a future of chronic federal budget deficits totalling at least $44,200bn in current US dollars.

This figure is apparently 94% of all US household assets. That&#8217;s some scary stuff. This makes the government sound like a dot com. Next thing you know, Bush will be calling for Aeron chairs for everyone in the country.
