[iTunes iSbogus][1] is a nicely done satire of iTunes that blasts people for supporting the existing music industry. I&#8217;ve been generally against the music industry and many of its practices, but the fact of the matter is that artists _voluntarily_ sign contracts with these records labels. And, no one has stepped forward with a viable business model that pays for the recording of the music and promotion that follows the release&#8230; there is a lot more that goes into it than just the artist&#8217;s original output. Places like [EMusic][2] offer a new model for artists.

Musicians have choices (and we better make sure that the legislature doesn&#8217;t remove those choices!)&#8230; if they want to be a &#8220;big name multiplatinum radio and MTV star&#8221;, the only way to do it today is via the major labels. Unless they&#8217;re really good at self-promotion.
