Dave Winer&#8217;s thread about gender in high tech continues with this [DaveNet piece][1]. Thought provoking reading (as is often the case with Dave). He comments that men are the artists and women are the infrastructure&#8230; which could be true, because that historically seems to have been the case. But, now that women are really being given freedom to pursue traditionally male interests, perhaps we&#8217;ll see more women on the &#8220;artist&#8221; side of things.

We may just find that men and women are inherently capable of the same things, but that the real difference is between individuals (regardless of gender).
