Interesting rumor, and totally plausible. Just as Amazon has thought &#8220;why not make some money off of all of this great infrastructure we&#8217;ve built&#8221;, it looks like Google is going to do the same thing: [Source: Google To Launch BigTable As Web Service][1]

> Google may be releasing BigTable, its internal database system, as a web service to compete with Amazon SimpleDB, according to a source with knowledge of the launch.

This will be one more non-traditional database among the many interesting choices that exist today.
