In a surprising move, [Arnold Schwarzenegger announced his bid for governor][1] of California:

> Although Schwarzenegger has never before sought political office, his fame and fortune are expected to make him a formidable candidate against a crowded field of lesser-knowns in an abbreviated two-month campaign.

If he wins, he would certainly not be the first Republican actor elected governor of California. Unlike Ronald Reagan, however, Arnold is ineligible to run for President.

Though he seems unlikely to win, it is also interesting to note that [Gary Coleman][2] is entering the race as well.
