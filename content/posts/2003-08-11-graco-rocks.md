I&#8217;ve really got to hand it to the folks at [Graco][1]. Their products are really well engineered and great to use! We just bought a Graco stroller to go with the infant car seat. It&#8217;s very solidly built and has many conveniences. Granted, that comes at a price: $70 at Target. But, this stroller will work great for us now (with the infant seat) and all the way up until Crysania is 40 pounds!
