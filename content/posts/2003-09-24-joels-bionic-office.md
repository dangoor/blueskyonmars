Joel Spolsky describes his new [&#8220;Bionic Office&#8221; layout][1], which he designed based on what he thinks will help produce great software. There are some neat ideas in there, and he even made it pair-programming friendly. Something of note is that I and many others have found that an open workspace can improve collaboration, but different people do have different work habits.
