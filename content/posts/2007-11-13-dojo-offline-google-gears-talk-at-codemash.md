The complete [CodeMash Conference Session List][1] is up now, and it looks like both of my talk proposals were accepted! I mentioned earlier that I&#8217;ll be giving an overview of the Dojo JavaScript Toolkit there. It turns out that I&#8217;ll also be giving a talk on Dojo Offline + Google Gears for taking your web applications on the road.
