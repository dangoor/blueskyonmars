Dianne Marsh of SRT Solutions talks a bit about TurboGears in the latest [.NET ROCKS!][1] podcast. Not surprisingly, .NET ROCKS! usually talks about, um, .NET. In this one, they&#8217;re talking a bit about other technologies. Dianne has had an opportunity to work with a broader array of technologies than most, so this is a good topic for her. (note to those reading this: I haven&#8217;t yet listened to the podcast, but I wanted to spread the word because I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be an interesting one just knowing the folks involved.)
