I just noticed the note on the [SQLite home page][1]:

> The new ADD COLUMN capability is made possible by AOL developers supporting and embracing great open-source software. Thanks, AOL!

(No snickering that they&#8217;ve only just now added ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN&#8230; remember that we&#8217;re talking about a 250K database). The interesting thing here is that AOL developers helped to enable this. Couple this with Apple using SQLite in the new [CoreData][2] feature of [Mac OS X Tiger][3] and it would seem that this little database is getting some hefty attention.

Sure, you&#8217;re not going to power Wal-Mart&#8217;s 1 million employee HR system on SQLite. But, as an embedded database in desktop apps, it works pretty well indeed!
