[Joel on Software &#8211; Good Software Takes Ten Years. Get Used To It.][1]: _&#8220;When you release 1.0, you might want to actually keep it kind of quiet. Let the early adopters find it. If you market it and promote it too heavily, when people see what you&#8217;ve actually done, they will be underwhelmed.&#8221;_ Another nicely written article from Joel.
