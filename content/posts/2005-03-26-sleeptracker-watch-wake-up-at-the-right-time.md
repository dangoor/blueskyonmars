I should really order this. The [SLEEPTRACKER][1] watch wakes you up within a time period that you specify, attempting to do so when you&#8217;re in your &#8220;almost awake&#8221; state. The idea is that by having an alarm go off then, rather than when you&#8217;re in a deep sleep state, you&#8217;ll wake up feeling more refreshed. According to [Gear Live][2], it really works.
