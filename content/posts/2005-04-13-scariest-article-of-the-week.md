I hope that [And the Verdict on Justice Kennedy Is: Guilty (washingtonpost.com)][1] is really talking about an extreme right-wing minority and not the 50% that voted for Bush. Check out this choice gem:

> &#8220;The Constitution is not what the Supreme Court says it is,&#8221; Schlafly asserted.

Wow. There&#8217;s someone that wasn&#8217;t paying attention in government class, or at least hasn&#8217;t read the Constitution.

This article talks a lot about impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Kennedy. I didn&#8217;t realize that such a thing was possible, and it&#8217;s certainly not desirable. Supremes are &#8220;for life&#8221; for a reason. While I hate to think of the types of judges that Bush will nominate, I do think that the system of government set down in the Constitution is a good one and worth following.
