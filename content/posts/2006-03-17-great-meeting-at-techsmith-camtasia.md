Yesterday, I had an excellent time meeting with folks at TechSmith. You may remember that a few weeks ago, I urged [people to pester TechSmith about a Mac version of their wonderful Camtasia product][1]. A few emails with Troy Stein, the Camtasia product manager, later and I was off to meet with them to discuss a wide variety of things going on at TechSmith.

TechSmith is one of those software companies that makes great products and really cares about their users. That&#8217;s probably a big part of how they&#8217;ve been in business 18 years (and they&#8217;re still growing quite nicely, from what I saw). As much as it sometimes seems like all of the interesting action is happening in California, there are quite a few high-tech gems scattered about everywhere. TechSmith is in Okemos, Michigan.

By the way, if you live near Okemos/Lansing (or would like to) [TechSmith is hiring][2] (a lot!). They&#8217;re hiring all kinds of people and there&#8217;s likely room for software developers of many different backgrounds. Check them out!

(And I&#8217;m still working on convincing them about that whole Camtasia for the Mac thing ðŸ™‚
