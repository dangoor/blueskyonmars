[The Standard: Online Music Bill Takes Aim at Big Labels][1]: _&#8220;Record companies that license songs to other online music vendors would have to make the same music tracks available to all competing services under a bill proposed in Congress Friday by Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., and Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah.&#8221;_ Yes, it won&#8217;t pass. But, it&#8217;s a great idea.
