[Skidoo Too][1] and the other Ruthsarian Layouts are some nice looking, tableless CSS layouts that are in the public domain. Worth remembering for the next time I want to re-layout Blue Sky On Mars. It&#8217;s fast approaching 2 years with this layout, which is not a very good layout in the first place&#8230; (Found this link via [Agylen][2].)
