The previous item that I posted about the RIAA losing an Appeals Court ruling linked to [My Way][1], which I had never heard of before. MyWay is _very_ similar to My Yahoo!, but one big difference is that they&#8217;ve taken the Google approach to revenue generation: unobtrusive text ads. No banners or popups (I&#8217;m using Moz so popups are a thing of the past anyhow). Very interesting. They claim to have been profitable from the get-go. I wonder if they&#8217;ll be able to make it last.
