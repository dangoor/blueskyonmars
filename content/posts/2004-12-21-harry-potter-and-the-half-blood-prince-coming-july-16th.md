Yes, I _know_ they&#8217;re kid&#8217;s books (though Goblet of Fire won a Hugo award). I&#8217;m still excited to see that the sixth Harry Potter book [is due July 16th][1]. No word one whether the trend of ever increasing page counts has continued. If it did, this would likely be a 900 page book.
