Tim Bray&#8217;s [Another Whack at Spam][1] declares:

> We can&#8217;t go on like just trying to live with and filter spam.

Though I agree with this sentiment, I don&#8217;t agree with his solution. I think the unmetered, free access to email is one of the things that makes it a successful medium. Tim mentions the one-to-many email newsletter&#8230; what about the many-to-many email lists? I think the Jakarta Struts list has around 2,000 subscribers. Does anyone who wants to post there have to pay $20? A vital form of communication will get damaged.

Beyond that, Tim&#8217;s recommendation will require changes to the client software. Sure, the changes may be relatively straightforward, but it would take a while before everyone is using a &#8220;registered relay&#8221; and you can stop receiving messages from people who aren&#8217;t. Other proposals require minor changes only to mail and DNS servers. That seems like a more tractable way to go.

I&#8217;m now getting considerably more spam than I would like. I&#8217;m considering changing my email address and giving the new address only to humans I know. Web sites and the like will get either temporary addresses or some other address if I have ongoing need to hear from them. Had I known to do this way back when, I may not have any spam today.

By the way, as soon as you get any spam, you&#8217;ve started your way down the track of having a useless mail account. Maybe Paul Graham has it right with his [filters that fight back][2] as a better approach to taking down the spammers. (Of course, the spammers can always just list fax or phone numbers instead of websites to get around the FFBs.)
