I&#8217;m a fan of bad stuff. Almost every year, I go to the [Smithee Awards][1] to enjoy some really bad films. So, I was pleased to find out about [the sci-fi writers who collectively wrote a bad book][2] in order to prove that a publisher was just a vanity publisher. The book is called Atlanta Nights, and you can conveniently [buy a copy][3] or [download the PDF][4]. I&#8217;ve read a couple of pages and it&#8217;s really quite awful, but it is awful enough to be entertaining. While looking at some of the slashdot discussion of this, I also discovered <a title="SS > SF > The Eye of Argon&#8221; href=&#8221;http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~susan/sf/eyeargon/index.htm&#8221;>The Eye of Argon</a> which is apparently believed to be among the worst sci-fi ever written. Unlike Atlanta Nights, The Eye of Argon was not intentionally bad. Woops.
