I always enjoy reading Joel Spolsky&#8217;s writing, and his latest ([Fixing Venture Capital][1]) is no exception.

> The fundamental reason is that VCs do not have goals that are aligned with the goals of the company founders. This creates a built-in source of stress in the relationship. Specifically, founders would prefer reasonable success with high probability, while VCs are looking for fantastic hit-it-out-of-the-ballpark success with low probability.

I think Joel is right on the money (in a manner of speaking). Another issue that Joel doesn&#8217;t go into is exactly what the VCs are expecting for an &#8220;exit&#8221;. He quotes Joi Ito as saying that the VCs want to cash out in 6 years. That means either an IPO or a sale. During the dotcom boom, many companies went for IPOs before the business was really ready for it. A public company has tremendous reporting requirements on it, and public shareholders sometimes seem to have a very near-term mindset (just watch how wildly many stocks will swing around earnings announcement time!)
