On the heels of Spam Gourmet and Jetable comes [Mailinator][1] which offers a twist:

> Later, come to this site and check the email for that account. Its that easy. Mailinator accounts are created when mail arrives for them. No signup, no personal information, and when you&#8217;re done &#8211; you can walk away. The emails will automatically be deleted for you after a few hours.

This is interesting, because you don&#8217;t even have to leave the site you&#8217;re on in order to create a new address. You do, however, have to go to their site to read messages that come in and have no control over how long the address lasts and the size of the messages. I&#8217;d probably give Jetable an edge here, but Mailinator is still cool.
