## Back in control

Recently, I&#8217;ve seen a fair number of articles where people are complaining about having the data under the control of one for-profit entity or another. That tension will always be there. One thing I can control, though, is this blog. With better software than I&#8217;ve had in the past, I hope to maintain my interesting sets of links (with commentary) on my blog in addition to Twitter and G+.

## Software Development

The new Montage framework from Motorola Mobility has some awesome ideas in it. Ars Technica has [posted an introduction by the framework&#8217;s creators][1]. The article also talks about Ninja and Screening, which are visual tools for building and testing Montage apps.

The Google Summer of Code project to build a graphical event timeline for Firefox is <a title="" href="http://grssam.com/2012/07/graphical-timeline-add-on-for-firefox-released/" target="_self">progressing nicely indeed</a>. You can download the add-on now.

Parashuram Narasimhan shows us how we can get going with IndexedDB today on browsers that don&#8217;t support it using [IndexedDB polyfills][2].

<a title="" href="https://github.com/benschwarz/metaquery" target="_self">Metaquery</a> is an interesting approach to breakpoints in web design. Of course, not everyone thinks breakpoints are the right approach, but this is still an interesting library.

Firefox add-ons have been <a title="" href="http://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2012/07/26/firefox-add-ons-cross-more-than-3-billion-downloads/" target="_self">downloaded 3 billion times now</a>. Firebug has nearly 50 million downloads. And those figures are from addons.mozilla.org alone. I know for certain that a significant number of Firebug downloads have come straight from the Firebug site.

Speaking of Firebug, did you know that you can <a title="" href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/firebug-tip-conditional-breakpoints/" target="_self">set conditional breakpoints not only for JavaScript but for XHR and even cookies</a> as well?

Lea Verou has [introduced Prism][3], the new JavaScript syntax highlighting library that she extracted from her [Dabblet][4] project.

[WeasyPrint][5] converts HTML/CSS (including print styles) to beautiful PDFs (well, assuming your original HTML/CSS was beautiful!). Unlike PrinceXML, WeasyPrint is free (BSD-licensed).

[How to make a game like Cut the Rope][6]. I wonder if a tutorial like this exists for the web? I enjoy Cut the Rope, personally.

## Other tech

Ed Bott finds <a title="" href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsofts-radical-new-business-plan-is-hidden-in-plain-sight-7000001750/" target="_self">Microsoft&#8217;s new strategy</a> laid out in MSFT&#8217;s 10-K. This is a bold shift for Microsoft. It&#8217;s hard to imagine Microsoft as the underdog, but to some extent that&#8217;s the position they find themselves in.

## Mac

<a title="" href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx?os-x-10.8" target="_self">Better Mac OS defaults for geeks</a> that I will likely not use all of, but there are a bunch of useful settings in here.
