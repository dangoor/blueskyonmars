A couple of days ago, I read something that talked about how politicians will sometimes pass deficit-causing tax cuts to force a reduction in spending and reduce the size of a government that is perceived to be too large. I guess that&#8217;s not the case with this administration, given that [they haven&#8217;t held to the 4 percent growth cap set by the President][1].

> Confounding President Bush&#8217;s pledges to rein in government growth, federal discretionary spending expanded by 12.5 percent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, capping a two-year bulge that saw the government grow by more than 27 percent, according to preliminary spending figures from congressional budget panels.

The article notes that even when taking out the war expenses and natural disaster aid, spending was up 7.9%. Do you feel that your $2.1 trillion is being well-spent?
