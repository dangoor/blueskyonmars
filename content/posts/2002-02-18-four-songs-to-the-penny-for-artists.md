The NY Times is reporting on [the miniscule size of artist payments on PressPlay and MusicNet][1]. All along, the labels have been saying that Napster was bad because the artists don&#8217;t get compensated. This article quotes that an artist would get $0.0023 per song downloaded. That doesn&#8217;t sound like compensation to me.
