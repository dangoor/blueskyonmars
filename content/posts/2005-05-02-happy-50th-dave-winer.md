Today is [Dave Winer&#8217;s][1] 50th birthday. [Happy Birthday, Dave!][2]. Love him or hate him, the guy speaks his mind and has definitely had an impact on the software business. I&#8217;ve been reading Scripting News for at least 6 years, and reading Scripting News is without a doubt what led me to implement RSS on my own site back in &#8217;99.
