Via Dave, I discovered that Ward Cunningham is going to Microsoft. There&#8217;s a page of [Tips For Ward At Microsoft][1] on his Wiki, of course. From what I have read, Ward is very big on openness (Wiki) and extreme programming (the original XP), so it will be interesting to see how that goes. The comments on the linked page are also rather interesting.
