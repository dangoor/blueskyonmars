The venerable New York Times is reporting on [the new definition of 24 hour days][1], now appearing at certain large corporations around the country. Now that&#8217;s progress! (Reminds me of the SNL sketch of a few months back in which they said that Bush works &#8220;24 hours a week, 7 months a year&#8221;).
