The beeb is reporting a [&#8216;Legal okay&#8217; for Russian MP3 site][1].

> According to Tass, prosecutors had decided not to pursue with legal action because Russian copyright laws only cover physical media such as CDs or DVDs and not digital files such as MP3s.

Of course, the Russians can always change their laws to cover digital media. I&#8217;m not sure that the content owners have the same sway over the Russian government that they do over the US and European governments.
