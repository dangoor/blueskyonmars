An excellent article at Linux Today talks about Open Source [losing to Microsoft.NET][1]. He talks about how Apache hasn&#8217;t really added anything revolutionary and isn&#8217;t heading in the direction of web services. Mono and DotGNU are basically just chasing Microsoft&#8217;s taillights. He said that J2EE is what we (as in Open Source folks) should embrace.

I&#8217;m not sure that J2EE is really necessary for web services. Interestingly, the talkback included several comments regarding Zope, which I have to agree does provide Web Services today!
