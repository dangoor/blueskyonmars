Today marked an interesting milestone. [TurboGears&#8217; Google Group][1] now has 453 members (up about 100 in the past week), which gives it more members than cherrypy-users! Google has upped the traffic category to &#8220;medium&#8221;, so another 141 people have wisely chosen to sign up [for the announcements list][2].

Given the fast growth and the size of the list, I find myself answering a lot of questions about TurboGears. According to Google, so do bonono, Elvelind, Ian Bicking, Jeff Watkins, Bob Ippolito and Phillip Eby. There are a few people who are also active on IRC (#turbogears at freenode).

In don&#8217;t-repeat-yourself style, I try to avoid answering the same question twice. There have been quite a few documentation updates that have sprung out of mailing list exchanges, and I&#8217;ll definitely keep that going. (The &#8220;comment on this page&#8221; links in the site have also been good at catching things! There&#8217;s been a number of good Trac tickets since I added that.)

Some of the questions are harder questions, because there are some things that TurboGears is perfectly capable of, but there&#8217;s no &#8220;standard way&#8221; to do it. The plan for the upcoming 0.9 release is to answer a few of the biggest no &#8220;standard way&#8221; questions. With the commentary and the code contributions that are coming in, things are looking good.

If you&#8217;ve ever had a &#8220;why can&#8217;t a web framework do this for me&#8221; sort of question, now&#8217;s a good time to pose it to the list. It just may be that the answer is TurboGears 0.9.
