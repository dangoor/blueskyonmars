Reuters reports that [the civil suit settlement proposed by Microsoft has been rejected][1]. Thank goodness&#8230; you&#8217;ll recall that the settlement MS proposed was that they would donate software to schools (thereby helping them improve their foothold in schools, where Apple has a traditional lead, which doesn&#8217;t sound like much of a settlement for wrongdoing).
