In February, I posted a [Legal Guide For Bloggers][1] that is currently the #1 match on Google for the phrase &#8220;legal guide for bloggers&#8221; (update a few hours later: that link has already fallen to last on the page of search results! Google works fast!). That&#8217;s not likely to continue to be the case now that the EFF has published:

[EFF: Legal Guide for Bloggers][2]

In my posting, I had collected up a bunch of links to good resources if you find yourself at the wrong end of a Cease and Desist (is there a right end?). The EFF&#8217;s guide is very in-depth and will likely cover any questions you may have. That&#8217;s the place to go if you run into trouble.

Thanks, EFF!
