In two days, I&#8217;ll mark [four years as a blogger][1] Seems like a good time to do something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for a few months now: switch to WordPress. There are a few little things that have been irritating me about MT. Those were quite possibly fixed by MT 3.1, but I wanted to head over to where a lot of the action was.

I&#8217;ve decided to go ahead and put things in place so that the WP blog is now in control. Next up: getting redirects in place for all of the old content, making sure the feeds are working right. 

Sometime soon, I&#8217;d like to move away from the default WordPress template. I don&#8217;t have time to deal with that right now, however.
