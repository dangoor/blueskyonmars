If you&#8217;re curious about the goal of this site, check out this article.

Why would you care what I write? For the same reasons you would care what anyone writes: you find the topic interesting, or the opinions resonate or dissonate with you. My purpose with this site is not to build some gigantic audience that I can &#8220;monetize&#8221;. My goal is to have a place where I can keep a journal of things that are interesting to me and thoughts that come to me along the way. Perhaps some of those thoughts will be interesting to others and we&#8217;ll get some discussion going&#8230; but given my real goal for this site, I&#8217;m basically guaranteed to succeed.

Some articles that show up here (the Features) are going to go through drafts and be refined, much like the articles of a &#8220;real journalist.&#8221; Much of what you read here, however, will lack polish because they are just thoughts quickly pushed online. Feel free to complain about my grammar or spelling, but you shouldn&#8217;t generally expect this site to read like the NY Times.

You may have noticed that I haven&#8217;t written about my &#8220;qualifications&#8221;. A writer&#8217;s qualifications are secondary to whether _you_ believe the argument being made. Granted, someone with first hand experience in an area can speak more easily about a subject and their word will often be accepted even without independent evidence. But, if the evidence provided isn&#8217;t convincing to you, it shouldn&#8217;t make much difference if the author is an &#8220;expert&#8221;. Always remember that humans are fallible. Experts are human, as are the people who elevated those people to the status of &#8220;expert&#8221;.
  
I have first hand experience in a few different areas that I&#8217;m likely to write about. But, feel free to question me about anything. (Likewise, I&#8217;ll feel free to respond or not as I see fit.)

Whatever brought you here, thanks for coming!
