Thanks to a generous offer from Cliff Wells, I&#8217;m pleased to announce [the Develix TurboGears Bug Bounty][1]. Develix will provide a year of free hosting for the people who help close these TurboGears tickets to get 0.9 out the door quicker. We&#8217;ve had many great contributions so far, and it&#8217;s nice that Develix wants to help those who are helping the project.
