[ABCNEWS.com : Concert Tours Are Where the Real Money Is][1]:

> Now the music labels, hungry for revenue from any source, are mulling over whether to make a grab for a piece of the tour biz. One company already has: In October EMI Recorded Music signed a deal with Brit singer Robbie Williams that gives the label a cut of the pop star&#8217;s merchandise, publishing, touring revenue and sponsorship.

This is in line with predictions that others have made and actions taken elsewhere in the world (like China). If the labels can start building non-CD revenue sources, they can eventually get out of the &#8220;number of copies sold&#8221; mindset and start making money regardless of the file sharing that&#8217;s going on.
