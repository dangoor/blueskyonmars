Another article in the long, ongoing debate (30 years? ðŸ™‚ about static and dynamic typing. Oliver Steele&#8217;s [Test versus Type][1] is probably the most accessible and believable of the arguments I&#8217;ve seen. One variable that he does not account for is that IDEs are able to provide you with more hints and assistance in statically typed languages.

I&#8217;ve come around to the point now where I think that static typing is actually not a bad thing. One major difference is that the folks creating dynamically typed languages are actively trying to make the programmer&#8217;s job easier. Despite being statically-typed, Java could compete favorably with Python and others if the language itself had some more features that are built in elsewhere.
