I had lunch with [Mark Ramm-Christensen][1] today, and he gave me the scoop on [PyOhio][2] which was last Saturday. It sounds like a good time was had by all. Mark guessed there were 80 people there, which is a good turnout for a regional event like PyOhio! Congrats to the organizers! It sounds like you did quite a job getting the word out and building the turnout.

I couldn&#8217;t be there because my daughter&#8217;s 5th birthday party was on the same day. Thanks to Mark, my [Paver][3] talk happened at PyOhio anyhow. He had the tough 2:30PM timeslot. If you&#8217;ve ever given a talk or sat through a talk at 2:30, you&#8217;ll probably remember that as &#8220;siesta time&#8221;. Everyone&#8217;s energy level tends to be very low at that point of the day.

So, thanks everyone for learning a bit about my new little project and to Mark for presenting my talk at that time and keeping the energy up.
