The folks behind the swell Kai&#8217;s Power Tools graphics filters have a Windows and Mac painting program called [ArtRage][1]. And it&#8217;s free!

> ArtRage is a painting package designed to provide a realistic and fun simulation of using paint on a canvas, along with pens, pencils, crayons, and other tools.

> Sounds reminiscent of Fractal Design Painter, which is probably beefier, but is definitely not free.
