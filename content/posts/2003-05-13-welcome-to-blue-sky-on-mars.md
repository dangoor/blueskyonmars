&#8220;Blue sky on Mars, that&#8217;s a new one&#8221; was one of the dandy lines from the cinematic classic _[Total Recall][1]_. The notion of life on Mars and human inhabitation of Mars often makes for some fun sci-fi. And, hopefully here, it makes for a good blog.

I&#8217;ll post an entry here sometime that talks about what We Write Online was all about, but I&#8217;m definitely a lot happier with the new blog name.

As you can see, I&#8217;m still on the default MovableType look. I plan to change that sometime in the not-too-distant future. Things fell into place with the name before they fell into place with the look.

Finally of note, Blue Sky On Mars is on a new server! That took a bit of work, but I found a good deal on service and so far the [new hosting company][2] has provided me with quite decent service and support as I&#8217;ve been getting set up.
