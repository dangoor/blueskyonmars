Anyone who runs a significant open source project should read this, especially if you don&#8217;t currently require your contributors to send in any kind of agreement:

<blockquote cite="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=679">
  <p>
    <br /> So why have it? Why create the barrier to entry for newcomers who just want to pitch in? I have great sympathy for the impatient potential contributor huffing â€œwhy do I need to sign this, anyway?â€, so this blog post is an effort to boil it down.<br /> [From <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=679"><cite>â€œWhy Do I need To Sign This?â€</cite></a>]

I&#8217;ve spoken with Alex a couple of times about open source intellectual property, and he&#8217;s definitely given this a lot of thought. For a project the size of Dojo, involving many very large contributors, having something like Dojo&#8217;s CLA seems critical for keeping the IP clean.

With TurboGears, from the beginning, I&#8217;ve required people to send in a simple contributor agreement and this sums up why: &#8220;One of the best aspects of the CLA process is that it gets people who are contributing to think about what it means to contribute.&#8221;. Significant open source projects that people depend on need to have contributors that are serious about maintaining the project&#8217;s quality <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> the project&#8217;s IP. Making people aware of this responsibility from the get-go is a big positive.

I&#8217;m posting this in hopes that more of my friends in open source software will keep these things in mind as their projects grow and the outside code contributions increase.
