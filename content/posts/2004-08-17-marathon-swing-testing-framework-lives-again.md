The last I looked at it (a few months back), [Marathon][1] was dead and required a bit too much patience to make work, especially when compared to Abbot. According to the much fresher looking site, a new set of people have taken over Marathon as of June and new releases have started flowing. Time to take another look. Abbot is good, but GUI testing can be hard and any tool that has a chance of making it easier is worth at least a quick looksee. I&#8217;ll report back if we make a switch to Marathon.
