If you saw the amusing [GridBag cartoon][1] from a few days back and are wondering how you can actually get your layouts to work, take a look at [this Javalobby thread][2]. Great stuff packed in there. I&#8217;ve had good luck with both FormLayout and ExplicitLayout, and this thread pointed me to [Explicit TableLayout][3] which uses ExplicitLayout to conveniently create table-like layouts.
