I am taking preorders for the [TurboGears Ultimate DVD][1], with more than 2 hours of new screencasts. Rather than copying the whole description here, or writing some new, less-useful description, I&#8217;ll just say &#8220;head on over and check it out&#8221;.

I&#8217;ve also got to comment on the new TurboGears merchandise. The tin TurboGears Toolbox is going to be quite the desk accessory:

But, I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting my hands on the new MarbleGears:

I&#8217;d imagine a lot of folks will be more excited about the DVD, which is great because it&#8217;s information I want to get out there. But I suspect that I, personally, will spend more time playing with my marbles than watching the DVD once it&#8217;s off to manufacturing ðŸ™‚
