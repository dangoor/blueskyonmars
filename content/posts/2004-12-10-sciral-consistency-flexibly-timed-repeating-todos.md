[Sciral &#8211; Consistency][1] is basically a todo list&#8230; or maybe a todo calendar. It lets you schedule a todo as needing to be done within a range of dates (and can repeat weekly, monthly, whatever). I&#8217;m surprised I haven&#8217;t seen a tool like this before. Very clever.

I saw this on [43 Folders][2], which looks like an interesting blog that&#8217;s hitting topics that I&#8217;m not seeing elsewhere. Stuff like [I-Search][3] and [TextExtras][4]. One for the blogroll, I think.
  
**Update:** I&#8217;ve tried Sciral Consistency now. It doesn&#8217;t quite do it for me. I&#8217;d really like to see that functionality directly in iCal, so that I can see timed appointments and timed todos side-by-side. I didn&#8217;t use it for very long, so I could be wrong about this: I would prefer a UI that let me just grab a range of dates, rather than actually typing in 2 days minimum and 5 days maximum. I hadn&#8217;t gotten to the point of a repeated entry, so I can&#8217;t really comment on how it works in that regard.
