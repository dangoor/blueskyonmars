After quite a bit of deliberation, I&#8217;m pleased to announce that I&#8217;m going to work for [Arbor Networks][1], starting on July 11th after my Month of Insanity is over. Arbor will be a great place to work and they made a terrific offer. I&#8217;ve previously worked with half a dozen people there.

Had Arbor not been so attractive, my decision would&#8217;ve been easier. I had to really think about what&#8217;s best for TurboGears and myself. (Thanks to Appropriate Solutions, Zesty News is continuing on solidly, and I&#8217;m looking forward to talking more about that in the coming months.)

Arbor uses Python and CherryPy today, so I&#8217;m going to be continuing work on the same technology. Arbor is a good open source citizen, so I may end up contributing _more_ _code_ to TurboGears than I have in the past couple of months. If I no longer need to worry about paying the bills, that frees up a lot of mental space and time.

Arbor&#8217;s products are very cool and useful. New internet security threats pop up daily, and Arbor provides a way for companies to spot the threat and neutralize it before it can cause too much damage. There&#8217;s quite a bit of interesting UI work, and I&#8217;ll get to sharpen my skills with JavaScript.

The timing of the move to Arbor is good as well. It comes post-DVD and book (and the other insanity of this month), so I&#8217;ll be largely trading work that I&#8217;ve been doing on the DVD and book for work on Arbor&#8217;s products. Blazing Things continues on. TurboGears continues on.
