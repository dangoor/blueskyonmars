Robert X. Cringley, [Why The Best Voting Technology May Be No Technology At All][1]:

> To vote, you write an &#8220;X&#8221; with a pencil in a one centimeter circle beside the candidate&#8217;s name, fold the ballot up and stuff it into a box. Later, the scrutineers AND ANY VOTER WHO WANTS TO WATCH all sit at a table for about half an hour and count every ballot, keeping a tally for each candidate. If the counts agree at the end of the process, the results are phoned-in and everyone goes home. If they don&#8217;t, you do it again. Fairness is achieved by balanced self-interest, not by technology.

This is a well-reasoned article with a simple solution to the voting problem. I&#8217;m a tech guy, so I tend to think of tech solutions. But, I must admit, that what he&#8217;s proposing does sound likely to reduce the chance of tampering. Even if getting results takes a little longer and costs a little more (which Cringley seems to think is not the case), I&#8217;m in favor of results that are more tamper proof.
