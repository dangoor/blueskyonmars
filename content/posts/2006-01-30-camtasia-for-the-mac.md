[Camtasia Studio][1] is the ultimate screencasting tool. For those of us using a Mac, we&#8217;re stuck with [Snapz Pro X][2]. Snapz is a fine screen capture tool, to be sure&#8230; but take a look at the features you get from Camtasia, and you&#8217;ll see that there&#8217;s really no comparison. Camtasia&#8217;s number one problem is that it&#8217;s Windows-only.

I&#8217;ve seen quite a few people out there using Macs to produce screencasts. TechSmith has had a hard time justifying the effort to make a Mac version of Camtasia. But, Mac users often seem to be more willing to pony up for a good piece of software. That, and there are quite a few developers running on Macs now. Maybe the market for Camtasia on the Mac is bigger than what TechSmith thinks it may be?

If you&#8217;d like to see Camtasia for the Mac, consider [sending them a feature request][3].

**Update**: [Camtasia for Mac][4] is [now out][5].
