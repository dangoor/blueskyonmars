Scientific American&#8217;s April Fools joke talks about how SciAm has [shortchanged ideas like creationism][1].

> In retrospect, this magazine&#8217;s coverage of socalled evolution has been hideously one-sided. For decades, we published articles in every issue that endorsed the ideas of Charles Darwin and his cronies. True, the theory of common descent through natural selection has been called the unifying concept for all of biology and one of the greatest scientific ideas of all time, but that was no excuse to be fanatics about it.

I&#8217;m glad that they have finally realized their mistakes and are now willing to listen to other opinions.
