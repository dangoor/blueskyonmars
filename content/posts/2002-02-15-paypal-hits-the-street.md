PayPal [went public today][1], raising $70 million for themselves and watching their stock climb 54%. Their closing price of over $20 a share gives them a market cap of over $1 billion. This is a company with no profits and $100 million a year in sales. Let&#8217;s hear it for irrational exuberance! Just wait until PayPal starts getting regulated.
