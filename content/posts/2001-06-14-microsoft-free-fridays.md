[Dave Winer][1] is proposing [Microsoft-Free Fridays][2] as a response to Microsoft&#8217;s attempts to leverage their monopoly to increase their control over the Net/Web. It&#8217;s an interesting idea. His plan is to not allow access to his site using IE on Fridays. One blog, [Unicast][3] has already implemented this, and is talking about going so far as to not allow Windows users.

That would probably be too difficult for many people to accomodate. I have not been keen on Microsoft&#8217;s moves of late, so an IE-free Friday may be a good idea&#8230; and it&#8217;s a chance for people to try out [Mozilla][4], which is starting to become a nice browser. (That&#8217;s Mozilla, not Netscape.)
