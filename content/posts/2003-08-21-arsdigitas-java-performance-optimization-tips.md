Found via jblog, the [Performance Optimization for Java][1] tips used in Java ACS. _Update:_ Even more useful is this [rebuttal][2] which includes a link to a [presentation][3] given by one of the HotSpot creators. If you really want to know what&#8217;s going on with performance, listening to a HotSpot person seems like a good place to go.
