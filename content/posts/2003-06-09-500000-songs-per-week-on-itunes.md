Though the BBC proclaims that [&#8220;confidential Apple music details [have been] leaked&#8221;][1], I doubt Apple really cares if these details are confidential. It&#8217;s all good, from what I see.

> The computer manufacturer is selling about 500,000 songs a week and about half of those are sold as albums, allaying fears that people would choose individual tracks instead of a whole record.

So, despite only being available to 3% of the computing public, iTunes is generating a not-inconsequential $26 million a year. Also of note:

> The independent music representatives were told they would be offered the same terms as bigger labels and have the same team looking after their tracks.

This is a very savvy move. Apple is in a stronger position in online music than anyone at the moment, and it&#8217;s better for them to avoid ceding power to the major labels and possibly stunting their available collection of music. Sure, the majors count for 80% of current worldwide music sales, but that other 20% has a huge array of offerings and by giving everybody good terms for online music, Apple can aim for selling everything.
