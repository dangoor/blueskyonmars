A father-son team in Spokane built this [nifty electric car called the Tango][1]:

> At 39 inches wide and 8 feet 5 inches long, it&#8217;s skinnier than some motorcycles and shorter than many a living-room couch. It runs on batteries, not gas.

People may be more readily accepting of this than the Segway. Only time will tell, however, if people really are willing to pay the price for environment-friendliness.
