I just had to link to this excellent letter by Bruce Perens regarding [GUI selection for UserLinux][1]. Different Linux vendors/distributions have had different target audiences and goals. This letter shows the kind of thought that is going into UserLinux, and the kind of decision made in this letter is exactly what it will take to get Linux on to corporate desktops.
