Since around April, people following TurboGears have undoubtedly noticed that my &#8220;public participation&#8221; in the project has been sporadic. I say &#8220;public&#8221;, because I&#8217;ve often had things going on behind the scenes for the project. But the fact is, that I&#8217;ve been busy. The DVD, the book, the presentations, the new job. With the exception of the job, which is a fairly predictable chunk of time, the other things were one time events. I figured that once I was past those, I&#8217;d have a certain chunk of time to devote to TG.

After getting a feel for what kind of time that was, I started working on a plan to make the project scale better. I outlined this in a message to the turbogears-trunk list on November 29th where I talk about TG 2.0. I&#8217;ve worked on getting more people situated in more roles in the project.

But there is more work to be done to fully get things organized around the ideas we have for TurboGears 2.0. TurboGears is a large enough project that there are plenty of people to help out. But, work needs to be done to get people going on the different things that need doing. Realistically, I don&#8217;t see myself having the time to do this in the near term.

In order to ensure that the project gets the attention it needs and can move forward as quickly as possible, I&#8217;ve decided to bring on a new Benevolent Dictator. I looked for someone who has been with the project a long time, has contributed good work, has some time to put into the project, has similar views on where to take the project and is a nice person (otherwise they&#8217;d be more &#8220;Dictator&#8221; and not enough &#8220;Benevolent&#8221;). There is at least one such person on the project.

Alberto Valverde is the new leader of TurboGears! A big thank you to Alberto for agreeing to pick up the project and carry it forward!
