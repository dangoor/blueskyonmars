[New Windows XP Feature Can Re-Edit Others&#8217; Sites][1]: _&#8220;In effect, Microsoft will be able, through the browser, to re-edit anybody&#8217;s site, without the owner&#8217;s knowledge or permission, in a way that tempts users to leave and go to a Microsoft-chosen site &#8212; whether or not that site offers better information.&#8221;_ This does seem like a scary abuse of the browser.
