It&#8217;s so nice when things warm up after a long Michigan winter. Crysania is taking her time in crawling, which makes her a bit more amenable to things like going out to eat. So, we did!

As you can see from the photo below, we weren&#8217;t the only parents there at the restaurant. The geese below were dining courtesy of a couple of kids at a nearby table.
