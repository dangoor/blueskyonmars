[Engadget][1] and [Slashdot][2] are reporting that Best Buy is going to stop their rebate programs within two years. Though Best Buy does not use TCA, as far as I know, this is probably a good move for them. CompUSA, who does use TCA, should pay attention, given that one of my most popular posts over time has been about [problems with getting rebates fulfilled][3]. Hopefully, the rebates will be replaced by lower direct sale prices.
