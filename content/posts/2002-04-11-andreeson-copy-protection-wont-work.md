Netscape co-founder (currently at Loudcloud) spoke to the National Association of Broadcasters about how [copy protection won&#8217;t work][1] for digital media. I&#8217;d be curious to know how the NAB received these words, but I believe they are absolutely true and that the truth of it will come out within a few years.
