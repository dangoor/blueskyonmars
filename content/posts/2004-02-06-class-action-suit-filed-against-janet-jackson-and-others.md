Wow. First, Snopes posted a story about [a fake lawsuit against Janet Jackson][1]. Now comes the news of [a real lawsuit][2]:

> A Tennessee woman has filed a class action suit against Janet Jackson and others involved in her breast-baring Super Bowl halftime show, saying millions of people are owed monetary damages for exposure to lewd conduct, court records showed on Friday.

Sure, people can sue for anything&#8230; but, wow. To characterize this particular publicity stunt as something worthy of compensatory damages just seems amazing.
