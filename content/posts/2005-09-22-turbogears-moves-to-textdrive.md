[TurboGears.org][1] is now running at [TextDrive][2]!

By all accounts that I&#8217;ve ever seen, the people at TextDrive are among the most clued-in you&#8217;re going to find in the web hosting business. They know how to run servers, and they understand today&#8217;s &#8220;agile&#8221; development tools.

When I described my [hosting problems][3], [Michael Koziarski][4], who works for TextDrive, was among those who offered assistance. The assistance offered: free hosting for TurboGears at TextDrive. How&#8217;s that for supporting open source development?

I should also note that Koz wrote the [Feed Your Reader][5] plugin for Firefox, which I make use of in [Zesty News][6]. So, I&#8217;m doubly indebted to him!

As soon as I&#8217;ve figured out some permissions issues, TurboGears will have its subversion repository up at TextDrive.

Thanks, TextDrive!

Update: I forgot to thank Jason Hoffman from TextDrive for setting me up and getting me rolling. Thanks, Jason!
