A question for the lazyweb, as I didn&#8217;t find an answer immediately via Google&#8230; how is it that I&#8217;ve seen a couple of random people register new user accounts, doubtless for nefarious purposes, even though I have user registration turned off on my blog? Yesterday, I even renamed wp-register.php, figuring that people may have been posting directly to the script. Is that not the right script?
