The Direct Marketing Association provides a way to [get off of many mailing lists][1] all in one go. It&#8217;s free if you register by mail. It costs $5 to register online. How much sense does that make? Clearly, registering online is going to _save them time_ rekeying and verifying information. Goofy.

I did notice that when you fill out the form to mail in, they assign a tracking number&#8230; so at least they&#8217;ve got it set up so they only need to rekey the tracking number.
