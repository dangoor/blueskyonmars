[Wall St.: From bad to worse][1] [[CNN Money][2]] The article talks about the market losing value two years in a row for the first time since the &#8217;70s. Hopefully, next year we won&#8217;t be looking back at three losing years for the first time since &#8217;41. (One thing that&#8217;s always worth remembering: if you invest for the long term, these kinds of drops won&#8217;t cause a problem.)
