I&#8217;ve just put a listing up on craigslist (holy cow that was easy! no wonder people use craigslist) for: [Music / broadcast studio desk with rack spaces $300 obo][1]. Though I&#8217;m hoping to have a bit more time for music in the near future, I wanted to really downsize my space. That&#8217;s why I had a bunch of gear up for sale a couple weeks ago, and now I have my desk up for sale.

Anyone who wants a nice 19&#8243; rack desk should check it out.
