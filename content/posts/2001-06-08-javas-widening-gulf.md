[Commentary: Java&#8217;s widening gulf &#8211; Tech News &#8211; CNET.com][1]: _&#8220;We interpret the message from JavaOne as follows: Users should not expect 100 percent compatibility among different Java vendors&#8217; platforms, any more than they should expect that from different versions of Unix. And the gulf between different Java solutions will widen.&#8221;_ This is absolutely the worst way to try to defeat Microsoft.

Microsoft maintains a healthy position by remaining compatible with **itself**. If the Java platform doesn&#8217;t provide write once run anywhere capability, then it may as well not even exist. From my experience, Java has been pretty good at compatibility for most application logic. But compatibility between Java app servers is another matter entirely.
