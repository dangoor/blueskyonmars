[Yahoo &#8211; Sun defends Java platform investment][1]: _&#8220;The company says it makes money by building services and hardware systems around Java, which it manages in a semi-open process.&#8221;_ I&#8217;m certain that Sun has generated business as a result of Java. It has been good for them both in terms of marketing, and in terms of providing technology that enabled developers to use their systems.

I think Sun would gain even more if they would replace their &#8220;semi-open&#8221; process with a completely open one. There would be no need for projects like Kaffe and Gnu&#8217;s Java library.
