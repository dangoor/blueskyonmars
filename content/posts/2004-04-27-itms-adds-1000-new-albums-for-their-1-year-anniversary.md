I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye on the iTunes Music Store&#8217;s &#8220;Just Added&#8221; section to see if there&#8217;s anything new I&#8217;d like to buy. This week, they added somewhere between 900 and 1000 new albums, which is quite a bit more than normal. My guess is that they made a big push to hit some magic number for Apple&#8217;s iTunes conference call tomorrow. I haven&#8217;t been keeping track, but I&#8217;m sure that they want to be able to say that they have more than 500,000 songs.
