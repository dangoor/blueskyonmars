After taking a fresh look at [Movable Type][1] the other day, I made the decision to switch over from [Drupal][2]. Drupal is still a spiffy piece of software, but I think it has different goals from what I want. So, as my blog approaches its third year, it&#8217;s been switched to its third blogging program (the first was [Thatware][3]). Hopefully, I won&#8217;t have to keep switching every year, because that&#8217;s not good for continuity in the search engines (every blogging program has a different URL layout). I&#8217;m planning to write an article soon about why I switched from Drupal to MT.
