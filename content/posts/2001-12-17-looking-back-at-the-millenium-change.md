There&#8217;s never been anything like it. It&#8217;s never happened before, and in our lives it will never happen again. If you screw it up you won&#8217;t get another chance. So play it safe and assume everyone means well, and let it go at that.&#8221;</i> [<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/">Scripting News</a>]</p>

  I didn&#8217;t expect that things would go poorly on January 1, 2000. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to play a good practical joke: we held a New Year&#8217;s Party, hooked up all of the lights (and the TV set!) to X10 home control interfaces and, as the ball touched down in New York, I clicked a button that turned <i>everything</i> off. There was dead silence as everyone stood there for a few seconds&#8230; Then I said &#8220;Just kidding!&#8221; and turned it all back on. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t miss that chance.
