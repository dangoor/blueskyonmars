It&#8217;s been less than two weeks since [Bespin][1] was introduced, and there&#8217;s already been an impressive amount of activity around the open source project. There are at least 3 entirely new Bespin servers that I&#8217;m aware of.

The current Bespin server that we at Mozilla are maintaining is written in Python and appears in the backend/python directory in the Bespin source. To help people get up to speed with the code, I have created a screencast to help people get started with the Python backend and give them an idea of how the code is set up.

I look forward to hearing your feedback!
