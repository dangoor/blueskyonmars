Some folks have started a new service called [Furl][1] which allows you to archive and search interesting pages you find on the web. Unlike a bookmark or a blog post, they actually store the content. So, if the original site goes away, you still have a copy of the content. Very nice, if it doesn&#8217;t run afoul of copyright laws.
