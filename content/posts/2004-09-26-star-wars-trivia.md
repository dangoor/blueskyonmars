In honor of this week&#8217;s long-awaited Star Wars DVD release, there has been no shortage of SW related articles. Like this one: [CNN.com &#8211; Naked Wookiees and broken R2-D2s &#8211; Sep 21, 2004][1]. Some fun bits of trivia there.

You know, Lucas didn&#8217;t write or direct Empire Strikes Back, which is often considered the best of the series. That should&#8217;ve been a hint.
