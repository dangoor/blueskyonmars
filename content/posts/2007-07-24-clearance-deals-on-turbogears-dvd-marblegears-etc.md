It&#8217;s time to clear out my warehouse space for some projects that I am starting up. I have slashed the prices on the [TurboGears Ultimate DVD][1] and the nifty TurboGears merchandise (the MarbleGears marble maze, the tin toolbox and the squishy, stress-reliever toolboxes).

The DVD, with more than 5 hours of material, is now under $10 while supplies last.
