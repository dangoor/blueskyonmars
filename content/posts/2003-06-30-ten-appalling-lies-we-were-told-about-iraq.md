Alternet offers [Ten Appalling Lies We Were Told About Iraq][1]

> So, months after the war, we are once again where we started â€“ with plenty of rhetoric and absolutely no proof of this &#8220;grave danger&#8221; for which O.J. Smith died. The Bush administration is now scrambling to place the blame for its lies on faulty intelligence, when in fact the intelligence was fine; it was their abuse of it that was &#8220;faulty.&#8221;

I find it interesting that there has been no real White House response (that I&#8217;ve seen) to the increasing number of articles that declares Bush and other senior White House staff as flat out liars.
