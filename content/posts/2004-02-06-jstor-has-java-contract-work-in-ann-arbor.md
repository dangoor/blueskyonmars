If you, or anyone you know, is a good Java developer in the Ann Arbor, Michigan area and you&#8217;d like a fun contract gig for the next few months, send me mail! (Use the link on my blog). This is an XP-style project, so if that frightens you, you might think twice about it.

The work involves creating Swing-based tools (persisted in a database using Hibernate) to manage the process of QA-ing more than 2 million pages of content annually. It&#8217;s a great project (it&#8217;s the one I&#8217;m working on), and we&#8217;re only in the second iteration right now. There has been some other work that came before the official start of the project, but it shouldn&#8217;t take too long for a good programmer to be fully up to speed.
