Psst&#8230; hey you. Yeah, you! I&#8217;ve got a deal for you&#8230; I hear Amazon.com has _[Rapid Web Applications With TurboGears][1]_ available for preorder at 37% off of list price! Yeah, I know the page doesn&#8217;t have much of a description right now, but this will be the book to have if you want more information on TurboGears (or SQLObject or Kid or MochiKit!). There&#8217;s even a bonus bit about SQLAlchemy! The book doesn&#8217;t ship until October 27th (according to Amazon, what would I know about such things?), but knowing you&#8217;ll get one of the first copies out is just a 1-Click away.
