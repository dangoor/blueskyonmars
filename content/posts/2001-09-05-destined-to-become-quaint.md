This quote, &#8220;Given the historic price-performance trajectories for storage, in a few years at least some high-end appliances will house hundreds, if not thousands, of books simultaneously, and certainly laptops with software book readers will house thousands or tens of thousands of books at once.&#8221;, from [The Future of the Book][1] article mentioned yesterday, is destined to become quaint.

Just like quotes from 1981 that say &#8220;someday everyone may have a computer with 100MB of storage&#8221;. I would bet that, with good compression, you could probably house tens of thousands of books on a laptop today. Assuming 100K per compressed book, you can fit 100,000 on a 10GB drive.
