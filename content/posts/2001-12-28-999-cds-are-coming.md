[CD prices set to take a plunge][1] &#8211; _Whether it&#8217;s piracy, a receding economy or simply supply and demand, sluggish CD sales will probably result in lower prices in the near future._ [[ZDNet][2]] The article quotes an analyst predicting that CD prices may permanently drop to $9.99. After years of selling CDs at higher prices than cassettes (because CDs are &#8220;new technology&#8221;), perhaps we&#8217;ll start seeing a bit better value. As long as I can continue to rip CDs to put on our server at home, $9.99 is not too bad a price. I&#8217;d really rather just by individual songs in MP3 format at $1 or less.
