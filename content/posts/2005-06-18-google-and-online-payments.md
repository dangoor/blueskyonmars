If this story about [Google&#8217;s plan to take on PayPal][1] has any truth to it, this may indeed be a fine time to invest in GOOG despite the $70 billion valuation. Why? Because my guess is that if they enter that market they have original spin on online payments. I can&#8217;t imagine that they would just offer up a clone of PayPal. Everything else they&#8217;ve done to date has had a significant technological edge to it.

**Update:**

This is what I posted in response to Scott Sanders&#8217; post [about Google going after micropayments][2].

That&#8217;s interesting. I very nearly wrote on my blog that Google could implement a functional micropayments system.

I&#8217;m just not sure that that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ll go after though. I was reminded of Clay Shirky&#8217;s article (that actually goes all the way back to 2000!) arguing that micropayments are bad, because people will need to make a thousand little purchase decisions every day. Imagine if your typical blog was 1 cent per page viewed. 1 cent is nothing and seems easy to throw away&#8230; but if every blog you viewed did that, you probably would view a whole lot less and think about what you subscribe to more. Here&#8217;s Shirky&#8217;s article:

That said, I do think you&#8217;re right that if Google pushed some kind of identity system and reduced the general friction in payments somewhat, they could produce a lower-cost (to buyers and sellers) system. This may have the sideeffect of enabling micropayments, but I doubt that their pitch is going to be about micropayments.

I&#8217;m certain that they&#8217;ll keep a transaction log and that it&#8217;ll be no big deal for them. (I betcha they have an absolutely enormous amount of data being logged as it is.)

One other thing to note that I didn&#8217;t see in the article that I had linked to or here: this story apparently was in the Wall Street Journal, which gives it a modicum of credibility.
