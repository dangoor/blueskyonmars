Kevin Kelly&#8217;s Cool Tools just had a link to [My-Cast][1]. I&#8217;ve generally been a fan of The Weather Underground, but I will say that My-Cast has a nice radar view and offers convenient emailed forecasts and alerts, all for free. (My favorite wunderground feature is the unadulterated text of the warnings that come from the National Weather Service. I&#8217;m not sure if My-Cast has that, because there are no warnings or watches at the moment.)
