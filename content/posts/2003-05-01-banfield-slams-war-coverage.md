[AlterNet: MSNBC&#8217;s Banfield Slams War Coverage][1] &#8211; This article does a great job highlighting the reason why free speech and free access to government information is important. How can we, as voters and the people ultimately responsible for America&#8217;s actions, make educated decisions without a total picture? Thank goodness that the Internet is still home to free speech. This very story probably would not have been broadcast in the mass media.
