Last week, a photo that purported to be a Rand Corporation mock computer of 2004 was circulating widely on the net. It was a nifty, seemingly plausible picture (though I did wonder what the steering wheel was for :). Snopes has the scoop, though. [It&#8217;s a hoax.][1] Or, not so much a hoax but a photoshopping contest entry. And a mighty fine one at that, if you ask me.
