CNN reports that [Universal Music is reducing CD prices:][1]

> In a press release Wednesday, Universal Music said it will reduce wholesale prices and implement a $12.98 manufacturer suggested retail price on virtually all of its top-line CDs in the U.S.

Interesting to note that CDs remain $4 more expensive than cassettes, despite the fact that CDs are easier to produce.
