Abhik pointed me to [iShowU][1]. This looks like a viable competitor to Snapz (though I haven&#8217;t tried it yet to be sure). The features list makes it sound like their recorder is highly optimized. If this works as well as it sounds and carries a price tag lower than Snapz&#8217; $70, this could indeed be a solid screen recorder for the Mac.
