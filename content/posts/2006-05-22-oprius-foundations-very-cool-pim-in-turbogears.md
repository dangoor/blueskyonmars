[Oprius Software][1] has just put up [some screencasts][2] showing off their in-development software. Oprius Foundations is a hosted, fabulously ajaxy personal information manager (contacts, calendar and todo right now). They make heavy use of TurboGears widgets and have created a beautiful interface. It&#8217;s cool stuff, and I&#8217;d link to them even if they weren&#8217;t using me as example data in the contacts screencast ðŸ™‚
