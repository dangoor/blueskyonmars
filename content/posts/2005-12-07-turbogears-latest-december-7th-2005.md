TurboGears Latest (December 7, 2005)

  * Work on TurboGears 0.9 is progressing well. The new features are largely
  
    defined (and many are well-baked). Next up: go through the open tickets and
  
    get the release out:
  
    <http://trac.turbogears.org/turbogears/roadmap>
  * TurboGears 0.8a5 was released to include upgrades of the included
  
    projects (including MochiKit 1.1 and Kid 0.8). Kid 0.8 is a must-have
  
    upgrade.

  * Ronald Jaramillo introduced another new feature of TG 0.9:
  
    Model Designer. Model Designer will be a part of the Toolbox
  
    that will let you create SQLObject model definitions
  
    via easy web forms.
  
    <http://www.checkandshare.com/blog/?p=27>
  
    Screencast: <http://www.checkandshare.com/images/modeldesigner.mov>
  * Not content to have just two major Toolbox tools, Ronald also
  
    introduced admi18n, which helps you manage the localization and
  
    translation of your application.
  
    <http://www.checkandshare.com/admi18n/>
  * See TurboGears at PyCon 2006! I&#8217;ll be doing talk #11 &#8220;Effective AJAX
  
    with TurboGears&#8221;. Mark Ramm will be doing talk #25, a tutorial session
  
    on TurboGears. See you there!
  
    <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2006/Talks>
  * TurboGears Sprint at PyCon. Help make TurboGears better and learn more
  
    about what goes on under the hood by joining us for one or more days
  
    of sprinting immediately following the main part of the conference.
  
    A good time will be had by all. Sign up on this wiki page:
  
    <http://wiki.python.org/moin/PyCon2006/Sprints/TurboGearsSprint>
  * diggdot.us is the first public site I&#8217;ve seen wearing the
  
    &#8220;TurboGears Under The Hood&#8221; logo. It&#8217;s also gotten a fair
  
    bit of attention (and traffic, I suspect) including a
  
    mention as the 3rd best mashup. Diggdot.us mashes Digg,
  
    Slashdot and del.icio.us/popular.

  * byteofpython.info is the second!
  
    <http://www.byteofpython.info>
  * Oprius Software has the distinction of having the second TurboGears job
  
    posting.
  
    <http://python.org/Jobs.html#oprius-software-inc-victoria-bc-canada>
  * Bob Tanner is working on packaging TurboGears for Debian:
  
    <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=338676>
  * TurboGears had a bike shed moment talking about a default URL
  
    style (more than 60 messages from more than 30 people,
  
    with another 10+ messages in a spinoff thread):
