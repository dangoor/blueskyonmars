C|Net is reporting about [studios trying to head off a bunch of DVD copying][1]. It seems that someone has written software that makes DVD copying relatively easy. Couple this with falling DVD burner prices, and you&#8217;ve got a stupid, scared industry. I say &#8220;stupid&#8221; because they are failing to learn from the past.

1) People don&#8217;t _want_ there lives inconvenienced by copy protection. The software industry showed this years ago.

2) No technical means of protection is fool proof. They will all be cracked.

The DMCA is not the answer. The answer is to use the existing copyright laws to prosecute infringers, starting with those who infringe for commercial gain. Followed by those who infringe on a large scale, but not for commercial gain. There has been, and always will likely be, some casual copying that goes on. This has not prevented the software, movies and even music industries from growing over the years.
