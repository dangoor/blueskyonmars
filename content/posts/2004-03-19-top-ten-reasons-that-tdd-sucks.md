With all of that talk about test driven development, I thought I would enumerate why TDD is completely misguided.

  1. I never have enough time to write the tests, **[once I&#8217;ve finished the
  
    main functionality][1]**.
  2. Testing isn&#8217;t my job, because **[it&#8217;s QA&#8217;s job to make sure I do quality work][2].**
  3. Unit tests don&#8217;t help me, because **my code works perfectly the first time**.
  4. Unit tests don&#8217;t help me, because **[my code always works perfectly when I add new features][3]**.
  5. There&#8217;s no need to test drive my code, because **[the design handed to me by the architect covers every possibility][4]**
  6. Running the tests is a pain, because **[it takes too long to scan through
  
    all of the output to see if everything was fine][5]**
  7. Running the tests takes too long, because **[reloading the database
  
    and restarting the app server between tests takes forever][6]**
  8. I can&#8217;t do TDD, because **[they don&#8217;t make JUnit for Z80 assembly
  
    language][7]**
  9. I don&#8217;t like TDD, because **[I enjoy the hours I spend in my
  
    debugger][8]**
 10. TDD is just a fad, and it&#8217;s completely unnecessary anyhow since **[projects always succeeded before][9]**
 11. (BONUS) TDD sucks because I agree with all of the points here, and I **don&#8217;t understand sarcasm**.
