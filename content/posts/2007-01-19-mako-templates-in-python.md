I didn&#8217;t realize it had been publicly released, but it has indeed: [Mako!][1] The prolific Mike Bayer has released a new open source template language. It&#8217;s a blazingly fast, plaintext-based, complies-to-Python template language with a pleasing syntax and useful features. Genshi remains my favorite HTML/XML template language, but Mako is a good choice when you&#8217;re going for speed (or if you dislike attribute-based template languages).

Mako works with [TurboGears][2] and also the newly released [ToscaWidgets][3].
