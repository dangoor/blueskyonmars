This time of year, assuming all of the money hasn&#8217;t gone into Christmas gifts, it&#8217;s always a nice thing to think about donating to a worthy cause. How do you know which causes are worthy? [Charity Navigator][1] is certainly one way! They take a look at how well a charity uses the money you give them, so that you can choose who will best make use of the money that you provide.
