San Francisco is using [Ranked-Choice Voting][1]. This is the way presidential elections should work. The only way such a change can come about is if _we the people_ actually make it happen. The biggest benefactor would be third parties, which can count on receiving more votes under such a system. Perhaps the Democrats might like it, too&#8230; given that Gore would probably have won in 2000 under such a system.
