[Business 2.0 &#8211; Magazine Article &#8211; In the Company of Spies][1] provides an interesting look at Science Applications International Corp. Sayeth the article:

> Most people have never heard of either Beyster or SAIC &#8212; and that&#8217;s fine with Beyster, the company&#8217;s reclusive founder and CEO. Privately held SAIC makes much of the supersecret technology that&#8217;s at the core of the sleuthing done by the National Security Agency, CIA, and other spook services. 

I wasn&#8217;t aware of SAIC&#8217;s involvement in the spook business, but I was aware of its existence. Some former ANS colleagues of mine have gone to work there.
