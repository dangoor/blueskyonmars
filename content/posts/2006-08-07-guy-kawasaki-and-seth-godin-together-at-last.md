One a-list business blogger interviewing another: [Signum sine tinnitu&#8211;by Guy Kawasaki: Ten Questions with Seth Godin][1]
  
I like reading Seth&#8217;s thoughts, even if he does keep beating the same drum (hey! he actually believes in what he writes!). I did enjoy Seth&#8217;s answer about what makes him successful:

If we define success as the ability to make a living doing what I do, Iâ€™d say the following:

1. No ulterior motive. I rarely do A as a calculated tactic to get B. I do A because I believe in A, or it excites me or itâ€™s the right thing to do. Thatâ€™s it. No secret agendas.
  
2. I donâ€™t think my audience owes me anything. Itâ€™s always their turn.
  
3. Iâ€™m in a hurry to make mistakes and get feedback and get that next idea out there. Iâ€™m not in a hurry, at all, to finish the â€œbiggerâ€? project, to get to the finish line.
  
4. I do things where I actually think Iâ€™m right, as opposed to where I think succeeding will make me successful. When you think youâ€™re right, itâ€™s more fun and your passion shows through.
  
5. Iâ€™ve tried to pare down my day so that the stuff I actually do is pretty well leveraged. That, and I show up. Showing up is underrated.
