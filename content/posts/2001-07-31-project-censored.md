Noam Chomsky writes [ProjectCensored.org][1]: _&#8220;They fall in a domain in which corporate-state interests are rather different from those of the public. That such stories would tend to be downplayed, reshaped, and obscured â014&#8243;censored,&#8221; in the terminology of the projectâ014is only to be expected on the basis of even the most rudimentary inspection of the institutional structure of the media and their place in the broader society.&#8221;_ [Project Censored][2] looks like a very valuable resource for people who are willing to consider issues that the mass media may not be willing to publicize.
