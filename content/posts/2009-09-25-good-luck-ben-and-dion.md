My now former colleagues Ben Galbraith and Dion Almaer have decided to [join][1] [Palm][2] to help push the mobile web platform forward for developers.

I&#8217;ve had a great time working with them on [Bespin][3], a project that they brought to Mozilla. And while I know that they&#8217;ve got some really cool challenges in front of them at Palm, I am personally excited about the next phase that Bespin is about to enter as we solidify the core of Bespin and drive it to become a tool that people will use day to day. I&#8217;m also happy that, since Bespin is open source, Ben and Dion will still be free to hack on it whenever they wish. In fact, they&#8217;ll be working with Joe, John and me on-site at Mozilla HQ next week as we kick off this long-planned-for work on Bespin.

Best wishes and best of luck to you, guys. I&#8217;ve really enjoyed working with you and look forward to meeting up as friends when I visit Mountain View.
