The ever useful Motley Fool&#8217;s Rex Moore has [a modified Foolish 8][1] screening criteria for stocks. The Fool is a great resource, and their stock picks are based upon really intelligent criteria (like: is the company producing actual usable cash, and do you know what their business is so that you can make intelligent decisions about the management?). In the article, Rex mentions a program that helped him do the stock screening. Another tool that I found is neat because it provides the software and historical data free, you just pay to stay up to date: [StockWiz.com &#8211; Advanced Tools for Serious Investors][2]. I haven&#8217;t yet checked to see if it has all of the criteria in the MF8, but since it&#8217;s free I can see how it does.
