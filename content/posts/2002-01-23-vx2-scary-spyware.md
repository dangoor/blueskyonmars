POE News has an [account of the discovery of some evil spyware][1]. The program, called VX2, appears to track all web activity, _including form submissions_. It&#8217;s hard to imagine scarier spyware&#8230; Apparently, this came with AudioGalaxy but is no longer included. Be careful when you install &#8220;free&#8221; software, because it may come with something like VX2.
