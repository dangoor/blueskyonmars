I&#8217;m writing this as I&#8217;m riding home from work on the bus. This driver has an intriguing way of creating his own traffic rules&#8230; He turned left from the &#8220;right turn only&#8221; lane at an intersection with _two_ left turn lanes. A few minutes later he drove around a parking lot to avoid an intersection with a traffic light. I can certainly appreciate a bus driver who wants to keep his schedule, but this is an interesting technique for doing so. Thankfully, he wasn&#8217;t making up new rules for the passengers: &#8220;everyone must where a hat&#8221;, &#8220;$5 tip required&#8221;, &#8220;no sitting&#8221;.
