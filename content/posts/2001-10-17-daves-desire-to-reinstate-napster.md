[Dave Winer says][1] the following about the music industry wanting to delete files on people&#8217;s computers: _&#8220;What they&#8217;re doing is pathetic, not evil. The evil is within me, for wanting to strike at them for their sad state. Much better approach. Make a pledge to not buy any music until they reinstate Napster, in all its glory. I&#8217;m good at keeping those kinds of pledges. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. I hope you join me. Cut off their air supply. No industry has ever deserved it more.&#8221;_

IMHO, Napster is finished, and has given way to better technology (Music City Morpheus). I&#8217;d like to see the music industry reinstate Napster-like services, but it&#8217;s not going to happen. At least not with _this_ music industry. It&#8217;s probably time for some new record labels.
