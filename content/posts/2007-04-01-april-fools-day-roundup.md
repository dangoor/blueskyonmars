April Fools Day on the web is a time for celebration of new products and new news. Here&#8217;s a roundup (that I&#8217;ll update from time to time) of the ones I like from today:

[Google&#8217;s TiSP][1] gives you free internet access via fiber optic cable that is run through your sewage lines. Google&#8217;s Gmail service now offers [Gmail Paper][2], where you can have your mail printed out and delivered to you. Gee, thanks, Google!

Who doesn&#8217;t remember gliding down in a [Stunt Monkey Baby Chute][3] when they were a kid?

One of [Woot][4]&#8216;s biggest sellers is their Random Crap item. Today, they had a deal going for one lucky buyer: get _three_ craps in a single bag for [just $1,000,001][5] (plus shipping).

Thinkgeek has trotted out a collection of new products. The [WiiHelm][6] for hands free Wii control. The [8-Bit Tie][7] should be a real product. [Caffeinated cigarettes][8]. [Lonely guy photo frame][9] that inserts you into vacations you wish you had. The [Vilcus Plug Dactyloadapter][10] provides an easy (likely one time use) way to see if your electrical outlet is working. They also have an [alarm clock that donates to organizations you don&#8217;t like][11] while you sleep.

You don&#8217;t have to be a World of Warcraft player to appreciate a good [Tinfoil Hat][12].

It turns out that the window transparency features that we&#8217;ve come to know and love can actually be a [security hazard][13].

[TattooYourToddler][14] sounds oddly realistic.
