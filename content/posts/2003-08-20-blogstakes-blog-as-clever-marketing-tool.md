Blogs take on many shapes: diaries, photo journals, lists of links that act as as massive, time-ordered bookmark list. [Blogstakes][1] has come up with a neat way to get people to put advertising right in with their blog links. By creating links to contests like the [The Clip-n-Seal Fresh Party Pack][2] and [Free BrowserCam for a Year][3], bloggers may bring a fair amount of traffic to the sponsors. Blogdex listed Blogstakes and the two contests today (3 of the top 40 links). Cool idea, and the site seems to be working dandy. Congrats on a good launch!
