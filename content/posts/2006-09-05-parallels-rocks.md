[Parallels Desktop for Mac][1] lets you run Windows (and other OSes) on your Intel Mac. I&#8217;ve had it for a few days, but one of my coworkers showed me the &#8220;Parallels Tools&#8221; today. Wow. Make sure you install the tools when you use Parallels with Windows. It&#8217;s so cool. The mouse seamlessly moves between Mac OS and Windows as the cursor goes over the Windows window. And, full screen mode looks right now (before I had black bars on both sides of my MacBook Pro&#8217;s widescreen display). I haven&#8217;t tried to VMware beta on the Mac, but I can say that Parallels at least is most excellent.
