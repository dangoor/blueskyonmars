I have just pushed [Paver][1] 1.0a1 up to the [Python Cheeseshop][2]. This is very much an alpha release, so beware. That said, I&#8217;m successfully using it in my own projects and have been for some time.

I have significantly changed the way Paver works, and I think the new structure is simpler and more flexible because it is no longer tied to distutils. In fact, Paver&#8217;s task running capability is in paver/tasks.py and that module could conceivably be used standalone. And, the namespace of tasks is not muddied with a bunch of distutils tasks if you&#8217;re making a pavement for some other purpose.

But, the distutils/setuptools integration still exists and is easy to turn on.

Paver 1.0a1 has a handful of useful new features, including the ability to run separate sub-pavements (in the same process, no less).

The docs on the Paver site are still for 0.8, and I will leave it that way for now. When you install Paver, you can run &#8220;paver paverdocs&#8221; to see the docs for the version of Paver you are running.

Please report any bugs you find either to the [googlegroup][3] or directly to the [tracker at googlecode][4].

Thanks to Marc Sibson, Bryan Forbes, Juergen Hermann and others who have contributed to this release.
