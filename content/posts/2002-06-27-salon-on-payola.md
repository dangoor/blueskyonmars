Here&#8217;s a great pair of links from a couple days back. Salon has done some reporting on the [current state of payola in the music business][1]. Technically, what they&#8217;re doing right now is _not_ payola, because that would be illegal. But [it amounts to the same thing][2] and it&#8217;s one part of the reason that music is priced so outrageously. Also of note is a comment in the slashdot thread, where someone pointed out how natural payola is and how those &#8220;greedy record companies&#8221; don&#8217;t really make much money [because 90% of albums fail][3].
