news.google.com had among the top stories that Dennis Kucinich has filed Articles of Impeachment against George W. Bush. You wouldn&#8217;t know it from looking at CNN.com, which includes such politically charged stories as [John McCain promising to &#8220;veto every beer&#8221;][1]. Maybe Lee Stranahan is right and what&#8217;s needed is [iPeachment &#8217;08 (3G)][2].

Though Bush is certainly worthy of impeachment, I cannot imagine these proceedings getting very far during an election year.
