So, we&#8217;ve got this book coming out _this week_, and it features 80+ pages on MochiKit 1.4, including the powerful Scriptaculous effects port. Karl Guertin&#8217;s new [MochiKit.Animator][1] makes the Scriptaculous port a much harder sell. I always appreciate beauty in an API, and this is a very attractive API indeed. It&#8217;s based on Bernard Sumption&#8217;s work, and this really looks like a solid choice if you&#8217;re using MochiKit.
