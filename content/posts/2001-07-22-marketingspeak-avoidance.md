[Brent Ashley][1] talks about revising his website to more accurately portray what he does. Something I wonder: Does marketingspeak work on anyone? If not, why do people still do it? I have a real respect for salespeople and their relationship building skills (at least those of successful, professional salespeople). I&#8217;m just not sure how marketing fluff fits in.
