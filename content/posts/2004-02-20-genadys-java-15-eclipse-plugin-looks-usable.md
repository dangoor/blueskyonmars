I was surprised to see the editor screenshot for [Genady&#8217;s Java 1.5 Eclipse plugin][1]. I thought the plugin only allowed you to compile the code, but didn&#8217;t really give you nice integration. From that editor screenshot, it looks like it does give pretty good integration. My group is currently working on internal tools that are due to be released mid-summer, so we could reasonably consider moving to 1.5. I wonder what the 1.5 release schedule is&#8230;
