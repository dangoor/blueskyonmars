Reuters is reporting that [Bush has raised a record $34 million][1] in the latest quarter. First of all, I do hope that this election is not decided by the person who raises the most campaign contributions. Granted that what I&#8217;m about to say sounds naive, but this should be about electing a leader who will do the things you want while in power, not the person who has the most TV ads. From the article:

> President Bush (news &#8211; web sites) raised a record $34.2 million in the last three months, dwarfing a field of nine Democrats led by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean&#8217;s Internet-driven $7.5 million haul.

What jumps out at you in that paragraph is the $34.2 vs. $7.5, a huge gap. But, hidden in that paragraph is the fact that there are _nine_ Democrats that each have a portion of the total contributions. Bush has the advantage of being the incumbent, running unchallenged for his party&#8217;s nomination. The nine Democrats may have raised nearly as much as Bush, but they will have to split the contributions and mindshare until some people start dropping out.
