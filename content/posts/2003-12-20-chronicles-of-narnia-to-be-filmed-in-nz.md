The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is going to be [filmed in New Zealand][1]. I&#8217;m a big fantasy buff. With all of the hubbub around fantasy these days (Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings have each banked about $1.8 billion in box office receipts), it would sure be nice if someone would make movies from the first six [DragonLance][2] books.
