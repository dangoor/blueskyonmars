Earlier, I had come across [Foxtrot][1] for easing the burden of handling long-running tasks in Swing apps. [Spin][2] has the same goal, but less code has to know that that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing. You _do_ need to use Interfaces for your model classes, but you were probably already doing that, right?
