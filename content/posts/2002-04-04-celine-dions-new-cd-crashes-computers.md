The Hollywood Reporter writes about [copy protection on Celine Dion&#8217;s new CD][1] which can cause computers to crash. To Sony&#8217;s credit, the CD is apparently clearly labeled as not working in computers. I&#8217;m really not sure what they think they&#8217;re accomplishing with this, other than cheesing off a lot of customers.
