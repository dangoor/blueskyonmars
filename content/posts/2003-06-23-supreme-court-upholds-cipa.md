Today, the Supreme Court ruled that [requiring public libraries to use Internet filters is legal][1]. For some portion of the population, public libraries are the only way to get access to the Net. It&#8217;s well-known that these filters prohibit access to quite a bit of non-pornographic information, so this law ensures that a portion of the web is simply unavailable to part of the population. That&#8217;s the real danger.
