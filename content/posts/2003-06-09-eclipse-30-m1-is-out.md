As promised on the roadmap, [Eclipse 3.0 Milestone 1][1] has been released. Though there is still a lot to come in Eclipse 3.0, Milestone 1 already offers a number of new features. Many things smooth over the interface, like &#8220;Smart Insert&#8221;:

> The automatic insertion of closing braces in the Java editor has been improved. Rather than occurring as soon as the opening brace is inserted, it now happens when a new line is entered after opening brace.
> 
> Also, there are two new experimental typing actions: Smart Semicolon and Smart Opening Brace. Disabled by default, they can be turned on from the Java > Work in Progress preference page. These typing actions move the caret to the end of the line before inserting the semicolon or closing brace, respectively.

There doesn&#8217;t appear to be the same rush on this milestone as there was for the 2.1 release.
