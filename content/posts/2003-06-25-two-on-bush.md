In the NYTimes, [Denial and Deception][1] talks about how so many people seem to stick their heads in the sand regarding how some of Bush&#8217;s statements have turned out to be false. Meanwhile, over in Slate-land, Timothy Noah contends that [Bush can be both ignorant _and_ a liar][2] and that people shouldn&#8217;t allow Bush off the hook.

Next year, it will be interesting to see if the Internet and the weblog world turns into a real political force. The articles that appear at the top of Blogdex and Daypop show that the blogging crowd have actively followed this story. Has the general voting public followed it though?
