[The Programmers Stone][1] looks like something to read in my &#8220;copious free time&#8221;.

> welcome to The Programmers&#8217; Stone. The purpose of this site is to recapture, explore and celebrate the Art of Computer Programming. By so doing we hope to help the reader either become a better programmer, understand what less experienced programmers are struggling with, or communicate more effectively with other experienced programmers.

Many topics are covered, so this will require a bit of reading before I can even formulate an opinion on its value.
