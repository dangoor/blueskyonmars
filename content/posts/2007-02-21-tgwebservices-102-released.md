Initial reaction to [TGWebServices][1] has been positive, and people have downloaded it&#8230; I haven&#8217;t had any direct feedback from users yet, but I&#8217;m certainly a user of the project. I&#8217;ve just released a new bugfix release. See the changes here: [TGWebServices changes for 1.0.2.
