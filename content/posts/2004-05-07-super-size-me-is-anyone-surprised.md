There&#8217;s been a lot of positive press for [Super Size Me][1]. I haven&#8217;t seen the movie, and it may very well be a well-made, entertaining documentary. That aside, the subject matter seems so obvious that it doesn&#8217;t warrant creating a movie about it.

The movie tracks the filmmaker&#8217;s (Morgan Spurlock) month of eating nothing but McDonald&#8217;s food. Obviously, he wasn&#8217;t eating McDonald&#8217;s salads every day, because he gained 25 pounds and got rather sick. Gee, big news there&#8230;

He could have just as easily done an expose on how your grocery store is a deathtrap, what with all of the cheeseburgers and fries you can make with ingredients from there, topped off with a Hostess Ho Ho for dessert. In fact, check out the quote from the NY Times critic that mentions that _Super Size Me_ is a statement of the obvious.

While I can appreciate the sacrifice the filmmaker made for his art, I really have to wonder if he had any other expectation going into this.

By many accounts the movie is a very entertaining view. That&#8217;s great&#8230; but for me the whole notion of watching a documentary based on the premise that eating unhealthy food all the time is bad for you just doesn&#8217;t sound like a great use of my time.
