When Phillip Eby works on something that has &#8220;head-exploding&#8221; properties, it&#8217;s worth paying attention to see why he&#8217;s putting forth the effort: [PyCells and peak.events][1]. Sometimes these things look academic and not useful in reality, and I&#8217;ve seen responses along these lines to TurboGears&#8217; use of Rule Dispatch. Really, though, this looks quite valuable for certain kinds of problems in certain kinds of systems.
