With the news that [Trolltech has decided to extend its dual licensing strategy to Windows][1], that means that Windows users will be able to use Qt-based GPLed software for free. That&#8217;s great news, because many people use Windows for a variety of reasons, and there are many good Qt-based programs that can now be run there for free.

I use a Mac primarily, but I also use Windows regularly. So, I&#8217;ve never given [the eric3 IDE a try][2], because I couldn&#8217;t use it cross platform. With the GPL release of Qt for Windows, maybe I&#8217;ll be able to. It looks like there is still a question of whether Riverbank Computing will follow suit with a license change for PyQt.
