[CNN.com &#8211; Deal reached at climate talks &#8211; July 23, 2001][1]: _&#8220;The 1997 treaty aims to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 5.2 percent of 1990 levels by 2012.&#8221;_ It&#8217;s sad that the US couldn&#8217;t come to agreement on this. We probably emit less CO2 per car than a developing nation would, but I&#8217;m sure the US emits _tons_ of greenhouse gases.
