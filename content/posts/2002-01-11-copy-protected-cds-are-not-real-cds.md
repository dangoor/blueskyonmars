Philips, the holder of many of the patents on CDs, reportedly said that copy protected CDs do not adhere to the CD-DA standard and therefore cannot bear the CD logo. They also plan for their coming CD recorder devices to include features to correct errors in CDs (essentially making the copy protection useless). If Philips owned a record company (which I don&#8217;t think they do at this point), they might think differently. But, I&#8217;m glad that they&#8217;re on the side of consumers on this one.
