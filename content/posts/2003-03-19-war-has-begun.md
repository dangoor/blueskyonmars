I&#8217;m sad to see it. Yes, I do hope for the best for the American troops who are doing their duty as ordered. I also hope for the safety of the Iraqi civilians. And I hope that things do not go as badly as in [Scott Rosenberg&#8217;s analysis][1]. And I do hope that ego and electioneering are not the main factors taking us into war.
