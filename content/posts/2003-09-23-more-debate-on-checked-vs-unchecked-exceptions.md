TheServerSide has a thread [regarding the use of checked and unchecked exceptions][1], in response to an [Artima interview with James Gosling][2]. This is a good read. CompSci always boils down to the tradeoffs you make, and it&#8217;s good to conciously decide how you&#8217;re going to handle something.
