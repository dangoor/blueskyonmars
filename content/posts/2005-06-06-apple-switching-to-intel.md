According to [cnet][1]:

> CEO Steve Jobs officially announced on Monday that Apple would gradually shift its Mac line to Intel-based chips over the next two years. The move confirms a timetable first reported by CNET News.com.

My take on Apple for a long time now has been that they fundamentally view themselves as a hardware company. They&#8217;re very good at software (since the NeXT acquisition), but the software is really used to drive hardware sales. The shift to Intel processors is probably just a tactical one: they get more bang for the buck and better chips for laptops (which are a huge seller).

If Apple were to start making OS X available as a direct competitor to Windows, now _that_ would be a strategic shift. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s gonna happen.

Update: I just saw the page for the [transition kit][2] for developers. This $999 kit \*includes a computer\*, which would certainly support the notion that Apple has no intention of letting people run Mac OS X on a stock PC.
