Amy Wohl [writes about Blogs in Knowledge Management.][1] This article acknowledges that there may be people that are not willing to just share all of their knowledge. Sharing of knowledge is important in a successful organization today, and should be strongly encouraged. I think the more success people have reading weblogs, the more they&#8217;ll want to write.
