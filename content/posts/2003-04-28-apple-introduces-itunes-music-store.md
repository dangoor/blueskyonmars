[Slashdot | Apple Introduces iTunes Music Store, iTunes 4, new iPod][1] &#8211; I linked to the Slashdot story, because the standard press release-derived articles don&#8217;t disclose the most important part to me: this service uses AAC files with DRM, not MP3. Sigh. I figured that would be the case, but why can&#8217;t they come to grips with the fact that I and many others will be happy to spend up to $1 a track for high-quality, no-hassle MP3 files?

Also of note: Apple has announced upgraded iPods and a new version of iTunes (with a Windows version on the way by the end of the year).
