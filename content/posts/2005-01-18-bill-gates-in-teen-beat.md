If you ever wondered why they don&#8217;t have more geeks in Teen Beat, though I never wondered such a thing, look no further than these photos: [Bill Gates Strikes a Pose for Teen Beat Photospread, 1983][1]. It is, of course, unlikely that these photos were _actually_ for Teen Beat, but they&#8217;re still funny.
