I&#8217;m about to do a little Swing work and I haven&#8217;t decided what kind of automated testing I want to do for this UI. But it was handy to see [Danno Ferrin&#8217;s GUI test tool roundup][1]. He and [Glen Stampoultzis][2] both came across a tool called [Marathon][3] which Danno describes thusly:

> Marathon &#8211; not perfect but Good Enough. Record option, junit playback, was able to get it working with my detateched test harness. Dosen&#8217;t record random key strokes like I would like it to, but it referes to the JComponents principally by the setName(&#8230;) value you gave to it. It uses Jython to record the test and play back the test script.
