The great thing about experiments is that they teach you things. Trying something and having it not work is not a failure. It&#8217;s _information._

I still believe in what I said in my [&#8220;What is SlowNews?&#8221;][1] post: the move toward real-time random links and news is a bad move, in general. That basic part of the experiment is not why I&#8217;m dropping my weekly SlowNews posts.

This blog is more than 8 years old, and I&#8217;ve always posted to it _for myself_. I&#8217;ve posted thoughts that I wanted to work out in writing. I&#8217;ve posted things that I wanted to share because I thought they could help people. I&#8217;ve posted about things that I thought were interesting and worthy of additional commentary. I thought these SlowNews postings would fit in that latter category.

But, I haven&#8217;t particularly enjoyed putting those posts together in the format I&#8217;ve been doing. While it is a chance to reflect on the happenings of the week, what I&#8217;ve done so far has felt too random. There&#8217;s too little narrative. So, for now, SlowNews goes back onto the idea shelf, waiting for a better implementation.
