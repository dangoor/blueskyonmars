Wired news, among others, reports that [the DOJ is no longer seeking the breakup of Microsoft][1]. Bush undoubtedly had a hand in this. They talk about imposing severe regulations on MS, but it seems like we&#8217;ve been down that road before. This step certainly won&#8217;t make MS fear the government any more than they had before (which is to say &#8220;very little&#8221;).
