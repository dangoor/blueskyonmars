Though I haven&#8217;t yet watched this week&#8217;s _American Idol_, I got an unfortunate preview from this article: [&#8216;American Idol&#8217; Voting Strikes Sour Note][1]. Once again, we see the ugly side of plurality voting (I wrote about this [last year][2]. When you have more than two candidates, just choosing your single favorite candidate does not do the job. I will say that it&#8217;s quite crazy that the three best singers, in my opinion, ended up in the bottom three&#8230; that&#8217;s unexpected even with plurality voting.
