CNET has an [interview with Jim Allchin][1], Microsoft&#8217;s VP in charge of Windows XP. To some extent, Allchin&#8217;s comments make sense. It&#8217;s Microsoft&#8217;s job to try to build products with features that people will want. However, he skirted the issue of Microsoft&#8217;s monopoly position. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any real question that Microsoft can destroy competition through Windows, and I don&#8217;t trust that kind of control in their hands.
