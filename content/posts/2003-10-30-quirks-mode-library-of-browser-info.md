Peter-Paul Koch has created a site that will likely help him keep busy as a freelance web designer. [QuirksMode &#8211; for all your browser quirks][1] covers all sorts of useful information about JavaScript, the DOM and CSS all with an eye toward cross-browser compatibility. That&#8217;s a good thing for folks who are still plagued with supporting Netscape 4.x. (I&#8217;m not!)

The Quirks Mode news page also looks valuable. From there, I discovered the handy [phrogz.net UL to menu converter][2], which does just what it sounds&#8230; turn your nested lists into menus! It&#8217;s that easy!
