Bill Venners wrote a good article comparing different ways to [test private methods in your Java classes][1]. In there, he points to [JUnit-addons v1.4][2], which I don&#8217;t remember coming across previously. This package provides a bunch of useful new asserts, plus a class that helps you run your private methods via reflection. (There&#8217;s a bunch more in there, too&#8230; check it out!)
