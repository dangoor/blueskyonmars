Congratulations to [Dave Winer][1] for winning at Wired&#8217;s [Rave Awards][2]. He won the top honor of Tech Renegade, an award which went to Shawn Fanning last year. Dave won for his work on and in support of SOAP, which is a much deserved award. As &#8220;web services&#8221; become more pronounced, we&#8217;ll all have Dave to thank for getting it started.
