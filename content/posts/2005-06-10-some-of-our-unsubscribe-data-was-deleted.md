This seems like a good tactic for a spammer. Here&#8217;s a message I just got from Chevrolet:

> Dear Kevin,

I can imagine some spammers accidentally forgetting to fix their weekly cron job that deletes unsubscribe data.

In this particular case, I&#8217;m sure someone at Chevrolet is getting mildly flogged. Not quite as badly as the Citibank folks who forgot to encrypt the 3.9 million customers&#8217; data on their backup tapes that UPS lost, though.
