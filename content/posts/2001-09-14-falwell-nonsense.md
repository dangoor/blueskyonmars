The Washington Post has an article about [Jerry Falwell&#8217;s comments][1] concerning Tuesday. Falwell said that the US got what it deserved because of liberals, gays, abortionists, etc. He also said, &#8220;When a nation deserts God and expels God from the culture . . . the result is not good.&#8221; Wrong. America hasn&#8217;t deserted God. I know plenty of Americans that are big fans of God (and of being good, kind human beings).

America has deserted closed-minded bigots with superiority complexes and an inability to change and progress with the rest of us.
