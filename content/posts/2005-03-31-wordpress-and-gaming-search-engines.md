I&#8217;ve got to [agree with Ian on this one][1]. It&#8217;s fine for an open source project to try to figure out how to bring in some money to support development. It&#8217;s another thing entirely to [abuse search engine advertising][2] to do it.

The decision of WordPress&#8217; founder to use his PageRank to get revenue via advertising for completely unrelated topics was a very poor one that will certainly alienate his constituency.
