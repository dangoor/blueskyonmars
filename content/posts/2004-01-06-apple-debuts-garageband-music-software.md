Apple has just announced GarageBand, a new part of their iLife series. It&#8217;s a digital music studio program including 64 track mixing, 1000 included audio loops, 200 effects, 50 software-based instruments. I&#8217;m a longtime Cakewalk user on the PC, so this is a cool announcement. Laptop music editing is becoming increasingly popular, and GarageBand should make it easy for me to record some tracks at home on the PC and edit/mix them on my Mac laptop. Nice.

Apple has also announced other goodies, like new versions of iPhoto, iMovie and iDVD.

iTMS is now over 30 million songs sold (sounds like a McDonald&#8217;s ad :). Apple has added Billboard charts to the store, which could be a handy feature for finding tunes. (Especially for pop-minded folks like myself.)
