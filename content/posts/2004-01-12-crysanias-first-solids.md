Today, Crysania had a few little tastes of Gerber Rice Cereal, heavily diluted with water. She didn&#8217;t seem very fond of it, but then this is her first &#8220;solid&#8221; food ever! It was hard to know how she would react. She has seemed anxious to eat solid food for a long time. (For all I know, after trying the rice cereal she may have been thinking &#8220;this is it? I&#8217;m goin&#8217; back to the breast!&#8221;.) Anyhow, it&#8217;s an exciting step forward into a very messy and stinky future.

In other Crysania news, she&#8217;s up to 13 pounds! Still small for her age, but my arms and back are fine with that for now ðŸ™‚ She&#8217;s gaining weight and is plenty healthy, so no worries there.
