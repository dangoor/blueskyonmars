Over the past few days, I&#8217;ve been doing some work with [CGLIB &#8211; the Code Generation Library][1]. It&#8217;s a great package for times when you want to implement AOP-like features in an efficient manner without classloader monkeying. The package is definitely actively maintained and developed (2.0 final was just released), and Chris Nokleberg and Juozas Baliuka were a big help in resolving some issues I had.

Thanks for the great project and support!
