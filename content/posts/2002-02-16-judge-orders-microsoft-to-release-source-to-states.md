The nine states suing Microsoft for anti-trust charges will have access to the Windows source (including the recent XP embedded), because the states claim that they need the source in order to prove that Microsoft could provide versions of Windows without Internet Explorer. That should be interesting&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t seem like an easy task to go through millions of lines of code (probably with no documentation, unless that was a specified requirement).
