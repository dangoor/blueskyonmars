Rolling Stone describes the [impact of Pro Tools on music production][1]. Though Pro Tools is definitely the big wig in the music production industry, I think they&#8217;re giving it too much credit for the revolution in music production. Cheap hard drives, fast computers, a wide variety of high-quality and inexpensive audio interfaces and many useful audio production programs are all contributors to the boom in home recording. There are still some parts of pro music making that many people can&#8217;t afford: high-end microphones, monitor speakers, etc. But, I think that the market for studios as a standalone business is likely on the decline.
