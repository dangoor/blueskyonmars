This article has no spoilers beyond what is shown in the previews for the movie. Besides, does it really matter now that the movie has made [more than $135 million][1]? Short review: I liked _Reloaded_, a lot. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one who would say that my favorite scene was the Burly Brawl (the fight between Neo and the many Agent Smiths). I also thought that the movie did a good job of continuing forward movement of the story and bringing some new depth to the world of The Matrix. We get to learn several more bits of &#8220;just how deep the rabbit hole goes&#8221;.

The meta part of this review: I read the Entertainment Weekly review of _Reloaded_ this weekend. The short form of that review was that _Reloaded_ is a mediocre movie that was raised up because of its stunning visuals (grade: B). They found the plot pretentious and didn&#8217;t particularly care for the acting of Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburn. They also didn&#8217;t seem to care too much for the script. Now, I&#8217;ll grant that movie and music reviews are very subjective, which is why sites like [Rotten Tomatoes][2] are helpful. But, I wanted to specifically comment on the plot of _Reloaded_. _The Matrix_ was great because they had to do all of that exposition and they were introducing us to a new and interesting world. _Reloaded_ couldn&#8217;t have that same sort of magical quality, because we&#8217;ve already been introduced to the world. But, I was happy with how many more ideas we were exposed to and where they let us off before making us wait for _Revolutions_. The Wachowski brothers have a lot to live up to for that third movie, but I&#8217;ve got faith that they know what they&#8217;re doing ([much more so than for certain other filmmakers][3]).
