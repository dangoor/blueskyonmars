There are some fuzzy statistics going on here, but it&#8217;s still a funny article: [Excluding Bill Gates, Dec. incomes seen rising 2.6%][1]

> Excluding Gates&#8217; $3.3 billion gain, personal incomes probably rose by 2.6 percent, with 0.3 percentage point of the increase going to just one really smart but not so tall man.

Microsoft paid out $32 billion of its massive cash hoard to stock holders. Guess who owns 10% of Microsoft?
