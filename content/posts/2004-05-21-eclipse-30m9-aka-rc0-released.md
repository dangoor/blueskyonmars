Let the [endgame][1] begin! [Eclipse 3.0 M9 News][2]

There are some great new features, and these are the last ones we can really expect for 3.0, now that the endgame has started. The CVS improvements are huge. &#8220;Commit Sets&#8221; let you group commits together by comment or time, which is _almost_ as good as atomic commits. (Not quite, though&#8230; I still want Subversion at some point.) You can also update to a different tag without rechecking out, and check out based on date.

Code folding, a bunch of new quick assists, an overrides marker and more really make this look like a slick release. Next week will be fun trying this out!
