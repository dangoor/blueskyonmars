Entertainment Weekly asks if [Fellowship of the Ring can beat Harry Potter&#8217;s box office][1]. Since Potter will take in $300 million, there&#8217;s no certainty that FOTR can beat that. The thing I don&#8217;t buy in this article is the quote: &#8220;Fantasy is box office poison,&#8221; he says, citing such duds as &#8221;Dungeons & Dragons,&#8221; &#8221;Dragonheart,&#8221; and &#8221;The 13th Warrior.&#8221; Why must people always do this? Fantasy is not box office poison.

_Bad movies_ are box office poison. So many glitzy big releases are filled with horrible plots, inane dialog and half-dimensional characters. Those movies often open big, but they fall off right away. FOTR is, by nearly all accounts, an excellent film. Take a well-known story, add in superb visuals, mix in a bunch of hype, and top it off with a real shot a big awards and I think you&#8217;ve got a movie that will pull in the money.
