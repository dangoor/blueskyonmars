The Michigan Python Users Group ([MichiPUG][1]) monthly meeting is coming up on Thursday, April 3.

We&#8217;ve got two exciting topics for this month&#8217;s meeting. The first part is [Mark Ramm][2] leading some discussion on documentation tools (including [Sphinx][3]). I roped Mark into this because I haven&#8217;t yet run Sphinx, but it looks great. He&#8217;ll also talk about [Idiopidae][4] which [Zed Shaw][5] and Mark were hacking on at PyCon.

I&#8217;ll also lead some discussion and experimentation with [EasyExtend][6], Kay Schluehr&#8217;s tool for monkeying with Python&#8217;s syntax.

Should be a fun time, and I hope to see you [there][7]!
