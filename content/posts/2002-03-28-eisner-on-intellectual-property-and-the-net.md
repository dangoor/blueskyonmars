OK, I&#8217;ll admit it. I had an idea of what [Disney&#8217;s Michael Eisner would say in the Financial Times][1] even before reading the article, and I figured I wouldn&#8217;t agree. It turns out that I only mostly don&#8217;t agree.

The first thing that jumped out at me from that article is this quote from Abraham Lincoln:

> The patent system changed this; secured to the inventor, for a limited time, the exclusive use of his invention;

I snipped out the bulk of the quote. This particular snippet mentioned &#8220;for a limited time&#8221;, just like the Constitution does. Man, to see Eisner of the Mouse House using a quote that mentions &#8220;limited time&#8221; is crazy! Disney was one of the big proponents of the Copyright Term Extension Act that keeps early Mickey Mouse films from falling into the public domain for another couple decades.

As I said above, I mostly don&#8217;t agree with Eisner. The part I do agree with is that stealing is bad. I do believe that copyright laws are useful, though I believe that the current terms are way too long. I also believe that a copyright owner has the right to decide how much they want to charge for their goods. And consumers have the right to buy other goods instead. I do not believe that copyright owners should choose how I use the goods for my own personal use.

I&#8217;m hoping to launch my new project soon and I hope to show Eisner and the music-loving public that big media has it wrong. And I hope that myself and others like me will be able to show this other reality before any more stupid laws are passed.
