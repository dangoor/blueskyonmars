As I&#8217;ve announced [in a separate posting][1], I&#8217;m going to go work for SitePen. I wanted to say a few things about [Arbor Networks][2], the company that I&#8217;m now leaving.

There are many plusses to working at Arbor Networks. There are a lot of smart people at Arbor, and Arbor does a good job of ensuring that the new folks coming in are also people you&#8217;d want to work with. Pretty early on in one&#8217;s career, you learn just how important it is to have good people to work with, and Arbor has lots of them.

Arbor&#8217;s engineering staff is almost all located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which remains my favorite place to live. I&#8217;ve traveled to many places and Ann Arbor suits my tastes well (YMMV). There are more than 60 people in the Ann Arbor office now.

Arbor has clearly reached a scale where it&#8217;s no longer a &#8220;startup&#8221;. It&#8217;s a private company, so I won&#8217;t mention financials. I&#8217;ll just say that the company is very solid and well-run.

Many people leave companies because they&#8217;re disgruntled about the work environment or company politics or some such. I&#8217;m leaving Arbor because doing so is the best move for my career.

If you&#8217;re into computer networking or security, I&#8217;d highly recommend checking [Arbor&#8217;s job postings][3] out. It&#8217;s a growing company with a lot of good things going.
