AlwaysOn has a two part interview with Larry Lessig about the changes that are needed in our copyright law. It starts with [Silicon Valley vs. Hollywood][1] and moves on to [Scrapping Copyright Law As We Know It][2]. From the first part,

> Yes, [teenagers have] grown up stealing music, and this is what really frustrates me. In 1998, people were saying we ought to have a compulsory license. If you had passed the Compulsory License Act then, we would have five to ten companies out there right now distributing music. They&#8217;d be collecting money; they&#8217;d be getting that money to artists.

It seems like this is obvious to many people who use the Net regularly, but for some reason the RIAA hasn&#8217;t gotten into it yet.
