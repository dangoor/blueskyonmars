With a great deal of support from Paul Everitt (of Zea Partners,
  
formerly Zope Europe) and the [EuroPython][1] organizers, I&#8217;m pleased to
  
report that I&#8217;ll be giving the keynote talk for the web track at
  
EuroPython this year. There&#8217;s a whole lot to talk about when it comes
  
to the what&#8217;s going on in Python and web tools, and I excited and
  
honored to be given the chance to talk about it at EuroPython. Python
  
and TurboGears are both quite popular in Europe, so I&#8217;m also excited
  
about the chance to meet some of the interesting folks in Europe that
  
couldn&#8217;t make it to PyCon.

I&#8217;ll post more about the talk as we get closer to the event.

EuroPython is July 3-5 at CERN.
