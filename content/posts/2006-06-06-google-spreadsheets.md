Like probably everyone else in the world, I&#8217;ve worked in a company that was hampered by inefficient spreadsheet mailing. I&#8217;m sure that many geeks other than myself have tried to come up with solutions to this problem. The [Google Spreadsheet announcement][1] is not a big surprise, and I think it makes a lot of sense. It&#8217;s hard to get people to change, and people are used to making spreadsheets, even when they&#8217;re not the &#8220;right&#8221; tool for the job.

The one thing that I think many will question is how sensitive of data they&#8217;re willing to put up on Google. Of course, thousands trust Salesforce.com with their pre-sales data, which is quite sensitive information. It&#8217;ll be an interesting psychology experiment to see how Google Spreadsheet gets used.
