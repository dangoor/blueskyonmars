[Pierre&#8217;s Web][1] is Pierre Omidyar&#8217;s weblog. He made some [interesting comments][2] about [BlogShares][3]. Since BlogShares is a fantasy market, it doesn&#8217;t hold a whole lot of interest to me right now&#8230; but, Pierre&#8217;s opinion on this is interesting, because of his status as a founder of a [huge market][4]. His weblog is located at the site of [Ginx: Nickel Exchange][5] which is another potentially large market in the making.
