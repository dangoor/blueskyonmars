I bought some RAM from Tiger Direct a while ago. I don&#8217;t remember anything being wrong with the purchase itself&#8230; but, since then I&#8217;ve been getting periodic emails with their &#8220;Ultra Product Updates&#8221;. I&#8217;ve followed the unsubscribe option more than once, and I also went through their front door customer service email. Customer service said that they had removed me from the list. Apparently they haven&#8217;t because I got another message today.

Luckily, since they&#8217;re just incompetent and not _trying_ to be spammers, I can just add a filter. Mailing lists are a fairly straightforward technology. It&#8217;s a shame that they can&#8217;t get a simple unsubscribe right.
