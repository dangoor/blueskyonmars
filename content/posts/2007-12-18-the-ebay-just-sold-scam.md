Today, I nearly fell prey to a phishing scam. I am totally not the kind of person who falls for phishers, but this was a wild one.

I was selling my PowerBook G4 12&#8243; on eBay and the auction ended today. As usual, the bidding intensified at the end, but a winner was declared at a price I was happy with. A short time later, I received an email from eBay saying that a payment has been made and giving me a link for the details. I clicked that link, not suspecting anything because I had, indeed, just sold an item. My browser&#8217;s location bar started out at cgi2.ebay.com, and went through a couple of forwards before landing on isapitems.pisem.su.

That page was done up with eBay&#8217;s logo and login page appearance, and I actually submitted my eBay username and password. Just after I did, something felt fishy about it and then it brought up a page styled like an eBay home page. When I saw that, I knew for sure it was a scam and immediately changed my eBay password.

I was really puzzled by this. eBay only lets you contact other members if you have an open transaction with that member. How could I have gotten such a targeted phishing scam? The answer came a couple hours later. eBay&#8217;s security people alerted me that the winner of my PowerBook&#8217;s account had been tampered with and bids had been made without his knowledge. _That&#8217;s_ quite the scam. Take over one eBay account and then win auctions just to get the passwords for more accounts.

While I&#8217;m glad that I escaped from the phishing net, it was a drag having to re-list the item. eBay deleted the entire auction. Thankfully, Google&#8217;s cache still had it so I could just cut and paste the text back in to a new auction.

If you&#8217;re a seller on eBay, just be aware that even emails with links that route through eBay could lead to phishing sites.

p.s. If you&#8217;re interested in my PowerBook, the [fresh auction][1] runs through Christmas day.
