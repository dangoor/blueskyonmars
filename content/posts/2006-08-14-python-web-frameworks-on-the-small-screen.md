In the madness before EuroPython, Mickey Hadick sent me a copy of his first episode of &#8220;All Others Pay Cash&#8221;. You can check out a trailer for it on Mickey&#8217;s [videos page][1]. I finally got around to watching the video this weekend. This episode, &#8220;Death By Chocolate&#8221;, is funny and worth a watch&#8230; for those of us doing Python web stuff, it&#8217;s notable for being, by my guess, the only sitcom to mention half a dozen Python web frameworks and even slide in a plug for Fuzzyman. While the chocolate is definitely the key to the episode, it&#8217;s fun being a part of a &#8220;crazed, desperate internet idea&#8221; subplot.

**Update:** Mick is working on getting the video into a film festival, so it&#8217;s not available in its entirety online right now. Wish him luck! As soon as he&#8217;s able, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll make the video available and I&#8217;ll post a message here when that happens.
