A year after launching [Gmail][1], Google has expanded the disk space from 1GB. They&#8217;re saying they expanded it to 2GB. Curiously, though, when I connected it said 1472MB. The next time I loaded my inbox, it said 1473MB. It is continuing to increase by 1MB every time I reload. Weird. I guess that&#8217;s a reward for using Gmail regularly?

They also added rich text formatting, which is a nice addition.

**Update**: Just noticed on the front page of gmail that they&#8217;re basically just counting up over the course of the day. It&#8217;s still weird.
