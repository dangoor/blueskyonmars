The founder of EasyJet, the dirt cheap trendsetting airline in Europe, [is trying again with movies.][1]

> How much did you fork out last time you went to the cinema? It was probably considerably more than 20p. But that&#8217;s how much you can buy a seat for at Britain&#8217;s newest cinema, which opens in Milton Keynes on Friday. 

Apparently, the film studios are giving him the blockbuster movies because of the lowball rates. In a way, this is not surprising, however. For a major release, the studio gets as much as 80% of the box office take. This is why concessions are so expensive: they are what pays the theater&#8217;s bills. At $8.50 a ticket, the studios are fine with $6.80 per admission to something like _The Matrix Reloaded_. With an average ticket price of $2.25 at Easycinema, that leaves only $1.80 for the studios.
