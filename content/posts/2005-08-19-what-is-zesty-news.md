After I first announced Zesty News, I mentioned that it was an RSS reader, and I talked a bit about making it browser-based and cross-platform, while still including reasonable support for things expected on Macs and PCs.

I hadn&#8217;t talked about what makes Zesty News special, and that&#8217;s just as well since I ended up delaying things a bit. Now that the alpha is out and available to testers, I have put [more information about Zesty News][1] up on [the Blazing Things site][2].

The things that are talked about on the Blazing Things site are features _right now_. They&#8217;re not vaporware. There&#8217;s a bit more to add before Zesty News Lite 1.0 beta is done.
