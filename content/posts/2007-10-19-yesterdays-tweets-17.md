  * _09:32_ is it just me, or does twitter need a more explicit way to reply that links/includes the original tweet? [#][1]
  * _10:02_ of course, with only 140 characters you don&#8217;t want to &#8216;quote&#8217; a tweet in the traditional sense [#][2]
  * _22:36_ why oh why did my WordPress plugins deactivate? without Akismet, bam! tons of spam. [#][3]
