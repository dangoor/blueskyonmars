Bruce Schneier has often spoken out against &#8220;security theater&#8221; (if you don&#8217;t know that term, it&#8217;s worth reading his new article). In [Schneier on Security: In Praise of Security Theater][1], Schneier actually talks about the real pros and cons of security theater and instances in which it even makes sense. I don&#8217;t read tons of security-related material, but this is the best accessible, high-level description I&#8217;ve seen for &#8220;how to think intelligently about security&#8221;. This kind of thing should be a must-read for our members of Congress.
