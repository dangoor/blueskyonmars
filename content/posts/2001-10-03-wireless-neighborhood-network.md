Byte has a very interesting article by Moshe Bar who set up a [wireless free Internet service][1] in his area. It&#8217;s a good read about the technology and issues. At the beginning of the article, he talks about how the Open Source business model is failing. I have to agree with what he says, but the fact that the open source &#8220;business model&#8221; is failing does not mean that open source is failing.

As long as a company has a real business model that brings home the bacon, there may still be plenty of instances in which using and contributing open source software makes good business sense.
