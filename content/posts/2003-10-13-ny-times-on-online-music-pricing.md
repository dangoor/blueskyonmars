The NY Times sums up the current view of online music pricing in [What Price Music?][1].

> After all, some say, antipiracy, anticopying technology may be available within the year.

> If that happens, the industry is likely to back away from the kind of pricing innovations with which it is now experimenting. Already, a strain is evident between record labels that want to restrict what consumers can do with the music they buy and the new on-line retailers, which argue that people won&#8217;t use their services if they can&#8217;t use it freely.

That right there says to me that the DMCA is stifling competition and innovation. Beyond that, copy protection _does not work_. It doesn&#8217;t work techincally and it doesn&#8217;t work as far as relationship with the customer is concerned. This was proven with software years ago, and that was before the Internet. With the Internet, a protection scheme can be cracked and that crack spread throughout the world within hours.
