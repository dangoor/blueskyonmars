I&#8217;ve been running the Google ads for three weeks now. Each week, my revenue from the ads has doubled over the previous week.

Given that, in just a few weeks, my Google ad revenue will be larger than Google&#8217;s current revenue. Early next year, I&#8217;ll be able to buy the whole U.S. Ahh, the joys of exponents.

Last week, 50% of my traffic came from one article that got some wide circulation in the Python community. I think that has something to do with last week&#8217;s doubling, and I have a feeling this week will be a bit smaller.
