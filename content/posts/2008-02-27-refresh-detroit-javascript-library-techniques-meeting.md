I&#8217;m just back from attending this meeting: [
  
Refresh Detroit Â» February 27, 2008 Meeting: JavaScript Library Techniques, Tips and Tricks][1]. Part of the abstract:

> The advent and popularity of JavaScript libraries has caused front-end programming paradigms to change drastically. Design patterns are emerging, object-oriented concepts are common place, and the line between client-side scripting and server-side scripting is beginning to blur. 

The talk was given by [Brian Reindel][2] of [Niche Retail][3]. (Brian formerly worked at [Fry Multimedia][4] and his wife currently works there. I never worked at Fry, but I worked with a few Web Elite people who moved on to Fry.)

Brian was angling for a tricky sort of talk. He was shooting for a talk that would expand people&#8217;s horizons from doing very simple &#8220;everything is a global&#8230; just call it in onclick&#8221; sort of JavaScript work to more complicated techniques like the module pattern and callbacks. He briefly highlighted some of the techniques used by JavaScript libraries (jQuery is Brian&#8217;s favorite). There were some good questions about accessibility (I mentioned that this is one of [Dojo&#8217;s strong suits][5]) and other JavaScript-library related topics.

I think Brian did a good job for a fairly brief talk. It would have taken a long time for him to get into closures and prototypes which are topics that many casual JavaScript users are not familiar with.

This is the first Refresh Detroit meeting that I&#8217;ve attended. It seems like it&#8217;s hard to get the word out about local technology-related groups around here. Some of the group&#8217;s areas seem interesting to me, and it&#8217;s possible that I&#8217;ll do a talk at a future meeting.
