If you use a Mac, you should check out [NeoOffice &#8211; OpenOffice.org for MacOSX][1]. I&#8217;ve been using NeoOffice for a couple of months now. It works very well, and eliminates my need for MS Office. I don&#8217;t use an office suite much, which is why I&#8217;m quite thankful to these guys that I don&#8217;t need to shell out the cash for MS Office. NeoOffice is far nicer than using OpenOffice under X, as well.

Unfortunately, it sounds like it will be a while before OOo comes to the Mac. Still, I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;ve got in this package.
