Tim Ferriss has done a bunch of great interviews or, more to the point, interviewed a bunch of great people well. On the latest episode, [he interviewed well-known marketer Seth Godin][1]. I enjoyed the whole show, even the bit about how to make chocolate at the end.

So, we cannot out-obedient the competition. Therefore, we have to out-lead or out-solve the other people. […] The way you teach your kid to solve interesting problems is to give them interesting problems to solve. And then, you don’t criticize them when they fail. Kids aren’t stupid. If they get in trouble every time they try to solve an interesting problem, they’ll just go back to getting an A by memorizing what’s in the textbook.
