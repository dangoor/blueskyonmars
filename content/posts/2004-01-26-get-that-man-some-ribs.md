On January 22nd, at 11:25AM MST, there were these [Remarks by the President to the Press Pool][1]:

> THE PRESIDENT: I need some ribs.
  
> Q Mr. President, how are you?
> 
> THE PRESIDENT: I&#8217;m hungry and I&#8217;m going to order some ribs.

This is a fairly amusing exchange. I tell ya, reporters have no respect. As Bush said, this was not a press conference, but the reporters just have to get their questions in.
