An interview on Winterspeak shows how [Sleepycat software][1] can make money on an open source product. They use the same model as Trolltech: release a programming library under a GPL-like license, and charge businesses that would like to redistribute the code with their proprietary products. It&#8217;s a good model for that type of software.
