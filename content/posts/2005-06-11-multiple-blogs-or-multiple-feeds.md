Since I started it, this blog has always been my &#8220;personal blog&#8221; and has never had an explicit focus. I&#8217;ve had around 575 technology- and software-related postings, so this is general a geek blog. But, I&#8217;ve had more than 400 &#8220;Random&#8221; things (these are usually entertaining bits found elsewhere, or some news about my site) and more than 100 postings in each of Music and Politics.

This made me curious: is it better to have multiple blogs or simply have multiple feeds on the same blog? Since the beginning of this year (before my switch to WordPress), I&#8217;ve listed three feeds: a feed for everything, one for Java and one for Python. 

I&#8217;ve seen other folks start independent weblogs for specific topics. It&#8217;s an interesting idea that has a certain amount of merit. If people are visiting the site with a web browser, then a topic site is a good thing. When you&#8217;re using a feed reader, it really doesn&#8217;t matter as long as you can get the feed you want.

I&#8217;ve always contended that I do this weblog primarily for myself. But, I also know that there are several hundred people who end up here every day, so I figured I&#8217;d see if anyone has a comment on how they&#8217;d prefer to see things show up.
