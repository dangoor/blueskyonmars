I came across IBM AlphaWorks&#8217; [Struts Action Scripting][1] a few weeks ago. It sounded interesting, but it suffers from the same problem as everything AlphaWorks: ambiguous licensing. It&#8217;s not open source, and it&#8217;s not even concretely commercial (there&#8217;s no defined &#8220;price&#8221; and distribution terms under which you can use the software). So, I&#8217;m happy to read about this project: [Scriptable Struts Actions Using BSF][2]

> This project allows Struts Actions to be written in the scripting language of one&#8217;s choice rather than as Java classes. It uses the Beans Scripting Framework to allow scripts to be written in any language BSF supports like Perl, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, BeanShell, and I believe even VBScript.

Actually, there is no license displayed anywhere for Struts BSF, but it does sound like the intention is for it to be open source.
