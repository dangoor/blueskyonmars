[How To Speed Up Firefox (Helpful Vanity)][1] includes a couple of settings to speed up your browsing when you&#8217;ve got a zippy connection. The main thrust of it is 1) try to request multiple things at a time, and 2) don&#8217;t wait to start displaying stuff. The second setting can actually slow things down a bit if the data doesn&#8217;t come in quickly, because Firefox will spend time rendering intermediate layouts until it gets the full information. It may be perceived as faster, though.
