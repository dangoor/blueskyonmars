Business 2.0 has an article about [improvements being made to bus systems][1] to make them more efficient and appealing to commuters. I ride the bus in to work every day, and I love it! Rather than dead time stuck in a car and then figuring out where to park (and coughing up the money for parking!), I just ride the bus. It&#8217;s comfortable, I can do what I want, it&#8217;s on time and the schedule is not bad.

Plus I get a few minutes of walking time in when I go to the stop.
