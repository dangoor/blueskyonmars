In the &#8220;oh, come on!&#8221; department: [SCO CEO says IBM behind open source attacks][1] includes this choice tidbit:

> &#8220;We have absolute direct knowledge of this. If you go behind the scenes, the attacks that we get that don&#8217;t have IBM&#8217;s name on them, underneath the covers, are sponsored by IBM,&#8221; [SCO CEO Darl] McBride said.

I&#8217;ve been avoiding adding more coverage to the already massive coverage of this crazy lawsuit, but these guys are even more deluded than it had seemed previously! I can guarantee that I think SCO is full of malarky and that IBM has nothing to do with that opinion.
