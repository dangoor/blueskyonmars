I haven&#8217;t looked at database reporting tools any time recently. Via [Niel Eyde][1], I discovered that there is a spiffy GUI designer for [JasperReports][2] called [iReport][3]. It looks like a spiffy tool, and I have a feeling that I&#8217;ll be developing some database reports in the next few months. Luckily, some folks have already thought about [Using JasperReports with Hibernate][4].
