Today, I gave a training session at work that lasted a little more than two hours. The session covered a Swing GUI framework that we&#8217;ve been building. (Yes, this framework is genuinely different from the others I&#8217;ve seen out there, and it&#8217;s even different in a good way :). I prepared for the presentation completely outside of the normal workday, because our project is due at the end of July and we&#8217;re busy pairing all day long on the code. I didn&#8217;t want to get in the way of that.

The presentation wasn&#8217;t bad, given the amount of time that I put into it. It certainly could have been better. I didn&#8217;t use a whiteboard during the talk, and I should have. Parts of it were not as well rehearsed as I would&#8217;ve liked.

After attending a session with Edward Tufte in April, I adopted his &#8220;no PowerPoint&#8221; style. I handed out an 8-page (2 11&#215;17&#8243; sheets) booklet that covered all of the examples I was using and gave some helpful reference information. One of my colleagues had the good suggestion of including a class diagram, which I will do if this comes up again. Instead of PowerPoint, I had Eclipse running during the session so that I could demo some running examples. With more time, I would have made more runnable examples. My handout had many snippets that were not in a runnable context.

And, a big kudos to our impressive Xerox Document Centre printer/copier. This thing actually took my eight separate 8.5&#215;11&#8243; sheets and turned them into a properly arranged 11&#215;17&#8243; booklet. That would have been very painful to assemble previously.

Presentation skills are important in nearly any job. It&#8217;s good to review the good and bad. I&#8217;m going to solicit feedback from the attendees to see how the training could have been better.
