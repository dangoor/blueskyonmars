Actually, I was already somewhat familiar with the Wal-Mart described in [Fast Company | The Wal-Mart You Don&#8217;t Know][1]. The article is a very interesting discussion of Wal-Mart&#8217;s tough tactics in dealing with suppliers and just what it means to be a $240 billion company. One interesting quote: &#8220;about 12% of the economy&#8217;s productivity gains in the second half of the 1990s could be traced to Wal-Mart alone.&#8221; That&#8217;s the kicker here. The article is reasonably balanced, but brings up the point that buying at Wal-Mart is moving a lot of jobs overseas.

Economic theory would tell us that in the long term, this is not a bad thing. In the short term, people are losing their jobs. But, the hope is that new industries will emerge in the US that will provide even better jobs. I read an article a few days back (I think it was in Wired) that described how our standard of living has improved quite a bit in the past few decades due to discount stores. Many things that &#8220;mere mortals&#8221; couldn&#8217;t afford have become far more accessible. Partly because those things have become cheaper, but also because we don&#8217;t have to spend as much money on necessities, thanks to stores like Wal-Mart.

Wal-Mart is squeezing efficiency out of the market, which ultimately should put more money in our hands.
