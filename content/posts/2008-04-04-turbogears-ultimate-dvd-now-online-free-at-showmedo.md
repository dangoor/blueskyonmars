In June 2006, I shipped the [TurboGears Ultimate DVD][1], featuring several hours of useful screencast material for TurboGears programmers. I produced the DVD with TurboGears 0.9a6 (or so) code, but much of what is talked about there applies to TurboGears 1.0x users. A big thanks to Ian Oszvald and Kyran Dale for putting the effort into getting 2GB of material transcoded and online: [TurboGears Ultimate DVD (TG v1.0) &#8211; video tutorials to learn turbogears, web\_development, web\_framework, python, javascript, web\_application, cheeseshop, generic\_function, JSON, metaclass, widget, API, sqlalchemy, cherrypy, sqlobject, WSGI][2]
