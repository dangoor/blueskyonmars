Here&#8217;s a good report from Tim Bray regarding a [meeting he organized with some dynamic language people][1]. Tim says that people inside of Sun were in favor of dynamic languages, but I hadn&#8217;t seen much of this until Tim&#8217;s posting. People from the worlds of Perl, Python and Groovy were all represented there, and they talked about things that Sun can do to make the JVM more hospitable to dynamic languages.

It can only be a good thing that Tim pulled this meeting together. The JVM has already proven to be capable of handling dynamic languages. Adding additional support to the JVM can only be a good thing.
