    Two days ago I dusted off the rarely-used voting procedure for Dojo Foundation projects in order to kick off a transition that Iâ€™m very excited about: as of this afternoon, the committers of the Dojo project have elected Peter Higgins the new Project Lead for the toolkit project.

So far at SitePen, I&#8217;ve had more of an opportunity to work with Peter than with Alex. Peter&#8217;s been a knowledgeable, always helpful and fun coworker. He&#8217;s going to do a terrific job for Dojo.

Alex has done amazing work to bring Dojo to where it is today (and it&#8217;s in quite a good spot). I&#8217;m certain that we (the web development community) are going to see very cool new stuff show up as a result of Alex taking a step away from day-to-day leadership on the Dojo Toolkit.

Congrats on the transition, guys!
