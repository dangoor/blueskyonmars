This is an oddity. Napster and Walmart both have [Nickelback][1] songs online, including their current &#8220;Someday&#8221;. Walmart also has Linkin Park songs, but not &#8220;Numb&#8221; (or anything else from _Meteora_). Since it appears that Linkin Park has agreed to single song downloads, why don&#8217;t Napster and Walmart have everything by them? Is it because they want to sell as many traditional CDs as they can before releasing for single-song downloads?

And, if Napster and Walmart both have Nickelback and Linkin Park, why doesn&#8217;t iTunes have either one? Apple has deals with all five major labels and is far and away the current leader in the music downloading biz. Why wouldn&#8217;t you find those songs on the leading service?
