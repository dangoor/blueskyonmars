TGWebServices is a package that I created earlier this year to provide a simple and powerful multi-protocol web services layer for TurboGears users. [TGWebServices][1] now has a new home at code.google.com, which will be easier to maintain. Clearly, that site needs some work and a new release needs to be made to point there, but that will happen all in good time.

TGWebServices now also has its own [mailing list][2] for the first time. Since this is a low-volume project, svn commit emails will go to this list, in addition to discussion about TGWebServices.

Justin Davis from [Arbor Networks][3] will be taking over the ownership of TGWebServices. Florent Aide, the [TurboGears 1.x][4] maintainer, has also signed on as a committer on the project.

TGWS is stable and has a decent feature set, so I don&#8217;t expect to see a lot of activity. Unless we manage to get the time together to merge TGWS and [soaplib][5], which is still a good idea.

Thanks to Justin and Florent for the continued support of TGWS!
