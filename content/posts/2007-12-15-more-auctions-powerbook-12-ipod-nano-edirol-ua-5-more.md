I&#8217;m nearly done revamping my office/music studio in hopes that I will actually have some time to play/make music when I finish all of this.

Ending tomorrow, I have an [Edirol UA-5][1] USB audio interface, a [2GB iPod nano][2] and a [Yamaha QY-70][3] portable music making gizmo. The QY-70 is basically a little battery powered synth and sequencer.

Ending later in the week: my [PowerBook G4 12&#8243;][4], which is a great little laptop. (I have a MacBook Pro now, and I don&#8217;t really need or want two laptops). And, my [music studio desk][5] with rack spaces is now up on eBay.
