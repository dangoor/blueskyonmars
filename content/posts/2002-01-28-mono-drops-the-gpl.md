[Ximian changes open-source license][1] &#8211; _The Linux company makes a philosophical shift in a key open-source software project that now will be governed by a less restrictive license._ [[CNet][2]] Mono has movied to a license adopted from XFree86, which allows use in commercial software. The primary reason for the shift is that Intel and HP have software to contribute and would not contribute it unless the license was changed. I think this is a good change, because Mono will be able to benefit from cooperative development like that.
