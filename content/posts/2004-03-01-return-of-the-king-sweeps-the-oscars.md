Lord of the Rings scooped up a few Oscars in the past couple of years, but this year [Return of the King won all 11][1] that it was nominated for. Miramax had reportedly tried to get Peter Jackson replaced as director before deciding to just hand the series over to another studio. That other studio, New Line, took a $300 million gamble to film all three at once. Worldwide box office for the three films is approaching $3 billion. Add in video sales, plus a bit of Oscar cred, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a $300 million bargain.

I can&#8217;t wait to see Return of the King. Having a 7 month old is not very conducive to getting out to the theater.
