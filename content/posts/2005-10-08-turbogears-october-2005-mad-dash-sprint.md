Today, we had the first [TurboGears][1] Mad Dash. I figured that calling it a &#8220;sprint&#8221; is probably not accurate, given that most sprints last several times the length of today&#8217;s mad dash.

Including myself, we had 10 participants. Given that I had announced my desire to hold a sprint just a few days after TurboGears&#8217; public release, the turnout was very good. Most of the people there were members of michipug (including two that I hadn&#8217;t met before), and we also had two hearty travelers from Cleveland.

I thought the day went well! Given that TurboGears is a three-week-old project (built on much older projects, of course), I hadn&#8217;t expected that we were going to generate thousands of lines of code (and we didn&#8217;t, of course). But, I had expected that people would get a chance to dive in a bit and learn what makes things tick and to collaborate and generate ideas.

On those counts, the day was exactly what I had hoped for. We&#8217;ve got some good direction planned for some TurboGears&#8217; 0.9 features, and 9 more people have now had some experience working inside various parts of TurboGears. We also spotted a bug in the forthcoming 0.8 release&#8230; it&#8217;s always a bonus to be able to stop a bug before the software ships.

A few people expressed interest in doing another sprint, possibly for a longer time than this one (less mad dash-like). The next one will also get moving faster, given that people have more familiarity than they did before. On IRC yesterday, there was talk about a &#8220;remote sprint&#8221;, which sounds a bit trickier to pull off. We&#8217;ll have to see about the remote one, but I&#8217;m sure there will be another Ann Arbor in person sprint sometime in the not-too-distant future.
