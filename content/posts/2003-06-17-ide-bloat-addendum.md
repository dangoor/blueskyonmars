Yesterday, I [responded][1] to talk about bloated IDEs by saying that they make me more productive. I forgot about Joel&#8217;s [great article on the topic][2]. Joel says that 80% of the people use only 20% of the features of the product, but it&#8217;s a different 20%. He&#8217;s right, and the same rule applies to IDEs just as much as it does for word processors and spreadsheets. 

That&#8217;s why plugins are a good thing for IDEs. Not everyone cares about UML, but those who do [can get an Eclipse plugin for it][3]. Even with all of the available plugins, Eclipse is still a large package, because even the basic platform needs to support many different styles of working, coding conventions, etc. That&#8217;s why Eclipse has so many preferences. But, we&#8217;re all programmers, right? Big tabs of preferences don&#8217;t work well for consumers, but we&#8217;re a bit better at grokking how features are configured via preferences.

I&#8217;m not trying to convince anyone to start using an IDE. Do whatever gets the job done for you. My point here is that there is a reason that IDEs are large and may seem &#8220;bloated&#8221;.
