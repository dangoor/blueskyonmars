My last day at Adobe was April 3rd. I am very fortunate to have worked at [one of the best places to work][1] during a phenomenally successful time as the company moved from packaged desktop software to a combination of software and services built as a whole.

I had the chance to work on interesting projects. Most of my time at Adobe was working on [Brackets][2], one of the top 20 starred projects on GitHub. I got to work with smart and dedicated people on a project that people love, how great is that? The project underwent many changes while I was there, and the [growth][3] was unbelievable.

Most recently, I was the tech lead for a new, as-yet-unreleased project. One thing that I think Adobe does really well is that it gives people many opportunities for career development. I have been a manager at other companies before, but I am enjoying being hands-on at this point. Even so, Adobe provided a path for me to be promoted (thanks to my managers for supporting me in that!). I had many opportunities for success, despite being a remote worker.

There are pluses and minuses to working at a big company. The _scale_ of what Adobe does can be breathtaking. I attended two [MAX][4]es (the creativity conference that highlights Adobe&#8217;s creative software) and two Tech Summits (an internal conference that brings together technologists from all over the company). These events are huge and well-run, and I enjoyed being on the program committee for the most recent Tech Summit.

Adobe&#8217;s scale enables it to create products that do things that no others do, and the pace of innovation is quite something to watch. I mentioned that there are downsides to big companies, and feeling like you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on in other parts of the organization is one of those downsides. That&#8217;s a genuinely hard problem and people do work hard toward spreading information as well as possible.

By this point, you might be thinking &#8220;if Adobe&#8217;s so great, why did you leave?&#8221; I did not go hunting for a new job, but I came across an opportunity that I just couldn&#8217;t pass up. That&#8217;s a topic for another blog post. I have no reservations about recommending Adobe as an awesome place to work and to all of the people that made my time at Adobe special: thank you!
