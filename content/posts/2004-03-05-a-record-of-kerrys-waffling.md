The article [John Kerry&#8217;s Waffles &#8211; If you don&#8217;t like the Democratic nominee&#8217;s views, just wait a week.][1] describes a variety of issues on which Kerry&#8217;s past statements and voting records contradict what he currently says. On the one hand, I think people should be allowed to change their minds about things, and some of the issues mentioned date back to the &#8217;80s. On the other, some amount of consistency in recent times would certainly be welcome.

There&#8217;s the saying that the known devil is better than the unknown one. I&#8217;m not so sure that this applies to this election (witness the fairly significant &#8220;anyone but Bush&#8221; movement).
