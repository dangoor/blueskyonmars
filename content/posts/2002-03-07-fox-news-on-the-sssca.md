Let&#8217;s hope some version of this [Fox News story][1] makes it on TV. The article blasts Senator Hollings for his blatant siding with the entertainment industries and against consumers. The SSSCA as a bill does not make any sense for anyone other than content holders. (And don&#8217;t forget that, according to the Constitution, copyright is there for the public good!)
