[ActiveGrid][1] sounds interesting. They&#8217;re creating a LAMP+java application server/application builder for making typical business apps. The key that they&#8217;re going after, and you can get this straight from their name, is easy deployment on grids of commodity hardware. Their tools support (or will support) several databases and PHP/Perl/Python or Java for development. Everything is XML-based, so much of the system is language-neutral.

It all sounds very interesting, but I&#8217;m left wondering what the business model is when I see a site like this. The application builder and server tools are available in early access right now (version 0.7, they say). And, they&#8217;re available under an Apache license. Are they starting one of the fabled services-based open source companies, or is there something else coming up?

I couldn&#8217;t find anything on their site that provided direction as far as ActiveGrid&#8217;s commercial offerings are concerned.
