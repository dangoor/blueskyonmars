Seth Godin has just written a couple of articles on [being small][1]. It&#8217;s great food for thought for anyone considering breaking away and going uncorporate.

> One of the implications of the Long Tail is that you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to work. That it&#8217;s easy to launch stuff, hard to figure out where it&#8217;s going to land. If you don&#8217;t have to bet the farm on every launch, you&#8217;re way more likely to launch more, and more randomly, which vastly increases your odds.
