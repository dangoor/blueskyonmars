After a couple of days blogging hiatus (visiting with my parents), I return to find this:

[Enron accused of new shredding][1] &#8211; _n/a_ [[CNN Top News][2]]. Yes, indeedy&#8230; these people are _still_ shredding documents. It&#8217;s bad enough to run a multibillion dollar con, but to actually continue to do things the same way after you&#8217;ve been caught takes some gall.
