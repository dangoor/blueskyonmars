Via [Lockergnome][1], I find [BugMeNot][2], a site that provides registration codes for tons of sites that require &#8220;free registration&#8221;. The NY Times is one of the best examples of this. One interesting thing about this is that this turns into a data point for those sites. It tells them how many people dislike free registration so much that they would hop over to another site to get a password. Sure, if they see a lot of people using a password from BugMeNot (or if they just monitor BugMeNot themselves), they can keep this from working. But will they? And how important is a couple fields of demographic information to advertisers?
