So slashdot had a posting about [MultiTheftAuto : blue &#8211; The revolutionary new multiplayer core][1] that talked about the &#8220;new core&#8221; without actually saying what MultiTheftAuto was. A couple clicks and I see that it&#8217;s a multiplayer extension to Grand Theft Auto Vice City. Since I play GTA on a PS2, I&#8217;m SOL unless I get Vice City for the PC. That might have interested me previously, but I have very little time for games, and I think all of that time will be consumed by San Andreas. I discovered a handy [news site][2] for San Andreas, as well as some [really amazing screenshots][3]. San Andreas looks like it&#8217;s going to be a big, fun step up.
