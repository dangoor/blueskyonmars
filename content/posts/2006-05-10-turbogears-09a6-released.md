I&#8217;m pleased to announce the release of [TurboGears][1] 0.9a6. I hadn&#8217;t planned for another alpha release, but there were some important fixes to get out.
  
The Widget Browser in the Toolbox is significantly more interesting now. For one thing, all of the core widgets now have &#8220;WidgetDescriptions&#8221; so that they show up in the browser. The other change is that the browser now shows the source of the description (which makes for a handy usage example) and the source of the widget&#8217;s template (so you can override it if you want complete control over appearance).
