Today, TurboGears 0.9a9 [was released][1]. This is a bug fix release with a couple of minor enhancements. The big difference with this release was that it was completely handled by Elvelind Grandin. Elvelind was, if memory serves, the first person (after me) with svn commit access to TurboGears and he has been helping out all along. Now he&#8217;s helping out as the TG release manager with the mechanics of issuing new releases. Thanks, Elvelind! (And thanks to everyone who continues to send in patches!)
