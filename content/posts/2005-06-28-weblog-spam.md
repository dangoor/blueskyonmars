Slashdot has a posting about the growing problem of [weblog spam][1]. They&#8217;re not talking about comments or trackback spam. They&#8217;re talking about whole weblogs that are nothing but spam for the search engines.

This is a problem for the search engines that are using RSS, and it will be critical for those search engines to come up with a filtering technique that eliminates the chaff from the wheat.

Luckily, though, this is not a general problem for RSS. Unlike email, you can subscribe directly to people&#8217;s feeds and be assured that you&#8217;re only going to get the items posted by those people. If you&#8217;re reading nothing but individual sources, weblog spam is completely non-existent. That&#8217;s one step up that RSS has over email. (That said, very little email spam gets through my filters these days, so I&#8217;m sure the problem is a tractable one for the RSS search engines.)
