There seems to be an ever-increasing number of articles on the sorry state of the music industry today. For example, the [NY Times says that CDs may be reaching the twilight of their market][1]. It has this interesting quote as well:

> Most analysts and industry executives agree that selling music online is the future. But they say it will take at least two years for companies to devise a business plan for it that makes financial sense.

I find the &#8220;makes financial sense&#8221; part of the quote interesting. I really think that the industry executives are desperately trying to maintain their current revenue levels.
