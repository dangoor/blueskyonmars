Hah! Hopefully with tongue in cheek, Kevin Maney of USA Today [writes][1]:

> President Bush meant to fall off his Segway. Oh, I&#8217;m sure of it. What we&#8217;ve got here is a clever conspiracy — a pre-emptive strike to save the oil industry from a technology that could sap its power.

He does confirm that the President did not turn on his Segway, which is why the stabilizers didn&#8217;t work.

I found the article amusing, because tumbling from a Segway seems like an odd way to dissuade people from using electric vehicles. The bit about Cheney owning a Segway and Dean Kamen himself delivering it to the White House was interesting.
