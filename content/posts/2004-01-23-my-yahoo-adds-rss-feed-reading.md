Jeremy Zawodny talks about the launch of [My Yahoo! RSS Beta][1]. Way cool. I&#8217;m already a My Yahoo! user, and this may be just the thing for me to kick the Amphetadesk habit. My Yahoo! is great, because I can access it everywhere.

I use the Amphetadesk outline view, and would be interested in a presentation somewhat more like that.
