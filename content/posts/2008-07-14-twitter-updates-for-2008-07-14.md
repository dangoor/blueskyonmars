    i wonder if Comcast is always experiencing higher than &#8220;usual&#8221; call volumes and wait times. <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858011624">#</a>

  <li>
    wow. that comcast guy was actually helpful. <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858028198">#</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    now to figure out why comcast thought we were sending out email at 4am a couple days ago. (no Windows machines here to do that!) <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858029398">#</a>

    @stevedress i think the higher volume just becomes a Comcastic! number of calls. &#8220;We&#8217;re experience Comcastic numbers of calls. Please hold.&#8221; <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858038415">#</a>

    @stevedrees but at least that wasn&#8217;t your normal call volume ðŸ™‚ <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858046801">#</a>

    I&#8217;m going to try FF3 as my default browser for a while. The extensions are quite tempting, and the speed is now good. <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858084791">#</a>

    @kalyke I&#8217;m switching from Safari (Mac) which is also a million times better than IE. Extensions are the only thing FF has on Safari. <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858094308">#</a>

    @kalyke My mom&#8217;s the only one I know that uses IE, and that&#8217;s only because she ran into a problem with FF and I couldn&#8217;t fix remotely. <a href="http://twitter.com/dangoor/statuses/858121172">#</a>
