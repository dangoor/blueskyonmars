I&#8217;m getting a new PowerBook, and Apple is running a $200 rebate on iPods for education folks, so I&#8217;m getting an iPod, too. I was rather surprised when tracking the Airborne tracking number, Airborne reports that the last (and only) scan location for the package was Shanghai, China. I thought that was a mistake in the tracking, but a call to Airborne yesterday confirms that the iPod is hung up in customs because it was actually coming from overseas.

It&#8217;s crazy to think that it&#8217;s actually cost effective for Apple to ship individual units from China.
