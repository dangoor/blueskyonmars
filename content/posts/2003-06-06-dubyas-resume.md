Though some of it&#8217;s a stretch, and it&#8217;s certainly not out to point out anything positive, this version of [George W. Bush&#8217;s Resume][1] is a bit scary because of how much of it is true. You can&#8217;t blame Bush for things like Worldcom&#8217;s accounting in 1999-2001, but you can blame him for many of the other things listed.
