Check it out: [Seth Godin in Ann Arbor Michigan &#8211; May 22nd][1]. This is what I like about Ann Arbor. It&#8217;s a relatively small city, but it is disproportionately active for its size. There are a lot of interesting technology, business and arts things that go on here.

If you&#8217;re interested in marketing and not familiar with Seth&#8217;s work, you should really check out [his blog][2].
