Warren Buffett writes, in [Dividend Voodoo][1]:

> Now the Senate says that dividends should be tax-free to recipients. Suppose this measure goes through and the directors of Berkshire Hathaway (which does not now pay a dividend) therefore decide to pay $1 billion in dividends next year. Owning 31 percent of Berkshire, I would receive $310 million in additional income, owe not another dime in federal tax, and see my tax rate plunge to 3 percent. 

All right, I admit that Warren Buffett is probably in a better position to talk about this than just about anyone. However, he doesn&#8217;t say anything about the argument that the money paid out as dividends has already been taxed at the corporate level. I agree that this tax certainly benefits the well-to-do more than the have-nots, though. And, I also think that doing a tax cut when we&#8217;re already running deficits is not likely to bring about the growth that the administration wants.
