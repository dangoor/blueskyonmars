[Amnesty International wasn&#8217;t pleased with the US&#8217; human rights track record this past year.][1] The US response?

OK, sure. The US is trying to advance freedom, democracy [and US oil interests] in the world. That&#8217;s certainly true. But to claim right now that the US is leading the way in human rights and dignitiy is absurd. From trying to find loopholes in the Geneva Convention to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo to even trying to hold \*American citizens\* without charges indefinitely, the US is not at all leading the charge in human rights.
