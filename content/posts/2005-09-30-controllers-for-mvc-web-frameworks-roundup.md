If you&#8217;re curious what some of the different styles of controlers in the various web frameworks look like, check out Ben Bangert&#8217;s [Best of breed Controllers for MVC web frameworks][1]. Understandably, he didn&#8217;t take a very in depth look at each framework and he missed some, but still interesting nonetheless.
