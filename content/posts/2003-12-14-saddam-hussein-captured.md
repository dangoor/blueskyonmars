[Yahoo! News &#8211; Saddam Captured Hiding in Hole Near Tikrit][1]

> U.S. troops seized Saddam Hussein hiding in a filthy hole near his hometown of Tikrit in a coup for Washington&#8217;s beleaguered occupation force in Iraq

This is certainly good news for the people of Iraq who have suffered under this dictator for a long time. This is not, in my opinion, a reason to keep Bush in office, and I do hope that the Democrats run a powerful campaign in the 11 months that remain.
