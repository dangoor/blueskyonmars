This is certainly a big deal. With a number of teams racing to win the X-Prize by launching passengers into space, Scaled Composites has [successfully sent a man into space][1]. The craft used cost just $20 million. With a price tag like that, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to think that at some point not too-far-off commercial space travel will be a reality.
