There are plenty of CMS choices today (a great many of which are free). For many types of projects, a Wiki acts as a great CMS, because anyone can edit. Wikis are nice, too, because many of them keep a revision history. Lots of open source projects use Wikis with the idea that users of the project can contribute documentation.

The trouble with a wiki, though, is that even though a revision history is maintained there&#8217;s no way to sync up the wiki with the versions of the software people are using. Or, at least, there&#8217;s no way built in to the wiki to do so.

I was thinking that a CMS or wiki that stores its content in subversion may offer the benefit of subversion&#8217;s branching and tagging. Lo and behold, I find that there&#8217;s a CMS called Sitellite that can [store content in subversion][1] (or CVS, but why use CVS these days?)

It would be interesting to see if Sitellite actually lets you tag your content and present older versions in an organized manner&#8230;
