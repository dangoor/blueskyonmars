[Furl][1] has always been a neat idea: if you see something you on the web that you like, toss it into your own personal filing cabinet for later retrieval. Yahoo has launched [My Web][2] which lets you do much the same thing, but it&#8217;s integrated directly with Yahoo! search and Yahoo&#8217;s toolbar. It also allows you to pick things up via RSS and they&#8217;re experimenting with attention.xml. Very cool stuff going on there.
