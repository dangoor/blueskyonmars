The Michigan Python Users Group had its third meeting on Monday. There were 8 of us in attendance at the Humantech office, which has been a fairly consistent number.

Roger Espinosa gave a good talk introducing [ElementTree][1] and [lxml][2].

And, as always, the unstructured part of the meeting was interesting and useful, covering a wide-range of topics. There was some interesting talk about Ubuntu (interesting for me, at least, since I haven&#8217;t run Ubuntu as yet).

We talked about scheduling, and I believe the final decision was that the next meeting is Thursday, December 1st.
