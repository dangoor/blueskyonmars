Our regularly scheduled MichiPUG meeting is coming on Thursday, October 2nd. The meeting will be at its usual time (7 PM) and at the usual place ([SRT Solutions][1]).

This month meeting topic is Python 2.6. A few months ago, we discussed Python 3.0 and all the new features that had to offer. It seems to make more sense to focus on Python 2.6, because it&#8217;s a release that we can likely use sometime soon. Coincidentally, Python 2.6 final is [due out tomorrow][2].

So check out [what&#8217;s new in Python 2.6][3] and come to the meeting with your choices of favorite new features.
