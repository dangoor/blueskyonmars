Ronald Jaramillo doesn&#8217;t tell me anything. He certainly didn&#8217;t tell me that he was going to build a GUI for TurboGears i18n: [admi18n: Painless localization in 10 steps][1]. Dan Jacob has been hard at work getting core i18n support for TurboGears (and that&#8217;s looking pretty nicely baked at this point). Ronald&#8217;s admi18n is a TurboGears 0.9 Toolbox GUI for simplifying the process of extracting strings and creating message files and translations for your app.

Great job, guys!
