[pigeon 0.1.0][1] just showed up in the Cheese Shop. Here&#8217;s the short description:

> Generates HTML documentation from python source

The long description includes this warning:

> Warning: This is an alpha release for those who are interested in
  
> checking progress. No documentation and not for production use.

I realize it&#8217;s an alpha release, but still&#8230; you&#8217;d think even the very first release of a automatic documentation tool would have some documentation?
