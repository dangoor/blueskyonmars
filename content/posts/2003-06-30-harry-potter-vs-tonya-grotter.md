Slate features the article [Harry Potter and the International Order of Copyright &#8211; Should Tanya Grotter and the Magic Double Bass be banned?][1] which makes the case the Harry Potter follow-ons published around the world should be allowed:

> In the end, few people are likely to mistake Tanya Grotter for Harry Potter; it is akin to mistaking Burger King for McDonald&#8217;s. The international copyright system is justified in preventing the most basic forms of piracy. But it doesn&#8217;t need to stop works like Tanya Grotter. The original Harry Potter is good enough to compete with its foreign cousins. So let a hundred Harrys bloom and let a hundred schools of magic contend.

There are definitely strong arguments for allowing &#8220;fair use&#8221; to ensure that people can criticize and parody the works of others. In the article, Tim Wu talks about books like _Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass_ being a sort of localized version of Harry Potter that would include local elements that JK Rowling could not write. That&#8217;s an interesting point, to be sure, but from what I&#8217;ve read, Tonya Grotter has quite a few similarities to Harry Potter and had actually been taken to court in The Netherlands because the publisher was trying to sell the books outside of Russia.
  
I would imagine that the courts, at least in the US, have fairly well defined notions what what plagiarism is and what constitutes fair use. I hope that those notions don&#8217;t just disappear on a global scale.
