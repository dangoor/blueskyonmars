I got email from someone who uses Earthlink as his ISP. Challenge/response spam blocking systems have existed for a while and are probably the most effective. However, Earthlink&#8217;s system is a bit overboard. Rather than _just_ clicking a link or responding to a challenge email, they require you to actually fill out a form requesting permission to email the user. C&#8217;mon&#8230; I&#8217;m not going to bother filling out a form to email someone. That&#8217;s loony. If it was as simple as confirming a mailing list subscription, I&#8217;d be fine, but Earthlink went a little overboard. They even have a CAPTCHA on their form!

Anyhow, in answer to Will&#8217;s question: Weird Al does not take outsiders lyrics. Check the [FAQ][1].
