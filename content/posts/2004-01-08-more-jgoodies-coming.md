The [JavaDesktop Forums][1] has a thread in which Karsten Lentzsch talks about additional java desktop goodies he&#8217;ll be releasing later this year (a data binding framework and a validation framework, as well as a demo app that ties it all together). I&#8217;ve been following the discussions about java desktop app building because I&#8217;ve been working through some data binding ideas as well.
