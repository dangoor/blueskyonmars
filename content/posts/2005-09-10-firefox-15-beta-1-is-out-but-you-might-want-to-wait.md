I recommended Deer Park a few weeks ago, and now the official [Firefox 1.5 Beta 1][1] is out! A word of warning, however: the Web Developer extension has not yet been updated for 1.5. And, for me, after I ran 1.5 on my Mac, my Deer Park alpha no longer sees extensions. So, I&#8217;m basically left without Web Developer until it&#8217;s updated. I&#8217;m sure that will be soon, but this is something to keep in mind if you&#8217;re a heavy user of Web Developer.

Update: the Web Developer extension has been updated to support Firefox 1.5 beta.
