[Blogshares][1] is a nifty fantasy stock market based on blogs that uses hyperlinks as the main measure of a blog&#8217;s worth. The site is interesting, but something seems lacking since Slashdot does not appear in the top lists. I guess it&#8217;s possible that this is because most people don&#8217;t link to Slashdot. But a link from Slashdot is something of great influence and it would be nice to quantify that.
