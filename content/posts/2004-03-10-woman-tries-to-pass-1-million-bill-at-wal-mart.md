Amazing. At first, I thought the tale of the [$1 million bill that leads to arrest][1] was one of overzealous enforcement. Everyone&#8217;s seen $1 million bills in joke shops, right? But look at the article and see that:

> Pike [the acused] then tried to use two gift cards worth only $2.32 to buy the merchandise, but when that did not work she again asked to cash the $1 million bill, Cotton said. The store then called police.

Err. This woman seriously tried to buy more than $1600 worth of stuff using a $1M bill. Wow. I wonder if there&#8217;s something like the Darwin Award for criminals?
