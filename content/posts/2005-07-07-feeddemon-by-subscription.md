If you&#8217;ve ever been curious what people think about paying for a &#8220;subscription&#8221; to a desktop application, look no further than Nick Bradbury&#8217;s announcement that [FeedDemon will move to a subscription model][1].

I&#8217;ve thought about this a bit myself, and one of the early commenters summarized my feelings on the subject well: something like internet-based synchronization (which NewsGator offers) is a \*service\* and charging that by subscription makes sense. Something like FeedDemon is a software \*product\* and you expect to be able to use that version of the product forever.

Expectations can certainly change. I know that Microsoft, which has saturated its main markets, is dying to hook everyone up on a subscription model. But, after 20 years of software-as-a-product purchasing, people need someone to come up with a good incentive to change.

I can certainly understand what NewsGator is driving at: they are setting themselves up as a services company and FeedDemon is one of their client tools. Makes good sense. They just need to figure out how to take care of the FeedDemon customers who weren&#8217;t angling for NewsGator&#8217;s services when they bought it.
