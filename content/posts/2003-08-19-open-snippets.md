Erik Thauvin in the JDJ newsletter talked about Java software repositories and linked to [Open Snippets :: GPLed Source Snippets, Served Daily][1]. Open Snippets looks pretty cool and supports several languages. Beware, though: the [default license for the code is the GPL][2]. As mentioned, you can write to the author to ask for a different license, but it&#8217;s still a shame that something like a &#8220;snippet&#8221; would be traded under the GPL.
