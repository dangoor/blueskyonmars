amk talks about how the Python Software Foundation is [funding PyCon travellers][1]. Since he has opened the door for me to do so, I&#8217;d like to say a big &#8220;thanks!&#8221; to the PSF for helping out with my PyCon travel. Between the conference and the looking-to-be-lively TurboGears Sprint, I&#8217;m spending a whole week in Addison, Texas. And, that&#8217;s completely on my dime, which is not a very easy thing when you&#8217;re still working on getting a business going. Or, that _would_ have been completely on my dime, if the PSF wasn&#8217;t generously helping out.
