It appears that some songwriters&#8217; groups have [lost their collective minds and sued MP3.com viral infringement][1]. They claim that people downloaded music from MP3.com&#8217;s locker service and then put it on Napster where other people downloaded it illegal. The only thing that makes this different from suing Musicland or Tower Records is that the songwriters didn&#8217;t give MP3.com permmission to put the songs online.
