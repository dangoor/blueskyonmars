Yesterday, GitHub [announced their new &#8220;Command Bar&#8221;][1]. I am a fan of command lines, and this is an awesome addition for navigating GitHub. I love being able to get more done without pulling my hands away from the keyboard.

You may remember that we&#8217;ve [added a command line to the Firefox developer tools][2]. It&#8217;s currently in beta, slated for release in about 3 weeks.

My reason in bringing this up is that **if you want to add keyboard controlled command line goodness to your webapp, you can do so easily**. The command line in Firefox is actually a separate open source (BSD-licensed) project called GCLI that you can incorporate into your own webapps!

[Fork GCLI on GitHub][3] and let&#8217;s see a thousand command lines, um, bloom.
