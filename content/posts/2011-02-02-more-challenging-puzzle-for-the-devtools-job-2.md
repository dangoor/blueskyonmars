Yesterday, I posted about the [Developer Tools Engineer][1] position we&#8217;re hiring for at Mozilla. The response to my little puzzle has been terrific, but &#8220;it&#8217;s too easy&#8221; was a common refrain. So, I decided to add two more little puzzles that follow the first. The puzzles are not intended to be time consuming, but they do use a couple of modern browser features.

[Give it a whirl][2] and say hi if you make it all the way through. One person completed it last night after I put it up but before I had a chance to write this blog post.

**Update:** it looks like this may only work in Firefox at the moment, and possibly only Firefox 4.
