I just came across this slightly older writing from Patrick about [the pain of ActionForms in Struts.][1] I, personally, have not written Struts code. In my last job, I managed some people who were writing Struts code, though. I&#8217;m aware of the benefits of MVC, but it really did seem like there was a whole lot of programmer overhead in writing Struts apps. xDoclet seems like one possible solution, but it really makes you wonder if the framework can or should be doing more. WebWork2 sounds promising, and we&#8217;re planning to try out both Struts and WW2 for an app we&#8217;re just starting.
