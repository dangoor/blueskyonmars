A small laptop bag maker has put the [&#8220;American apology&#8221; on the care label of their bags][1]. It&#8217;s really funny, a trifle subversive, and likely to pass right by the many Americans who (a) don&#8217;t speak French and (b) don&#8217;t read care labels. (The apology, by the way, is &#8220;We are sorry that our President is an idiot. We didn&#8217;t vote for him.&#8221;) There are [t-shirts available from the originator of the slogan][2].
