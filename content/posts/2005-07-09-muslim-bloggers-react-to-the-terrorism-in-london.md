[Dave Winer][1] points to Rebecca McKinnon&#8217;s roundup of [reactions from Muslim bloggers][2] to Thursday&#8217;s bombings in London. The reactions are what you&#8217;d expect (and hope for): sadness for those lost and anger at the terrorists. I&#8217;m curious about the reaction from &#8220;normal&#8221; Muslims around the world. Given the state of infrastructure, the standard of living, and government censorship in the Middle East and elsewhere, looking at reactions from bloggers will only give you the view of the well-educated and well-off. To really get a sense for how people feel about the situation (and how much popular support these terrorists have), we&#8217;d need to hear from the proverbial &#8220;man in the street&#8221; from Muslim nations.
