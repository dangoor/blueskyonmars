It sounds like the Razzies had a great year! George W. Bush won the worst actor razzie for his performance as President in Farenheit 911. [Halle Berry won worst actress][1] for Catwoman, but she actually showed up to accept! She had her Oscar in hand and said how she went from the top of her profession to the bottom.

> &#8220;I want to thank Warner Brothers for casting me in this piece of shit,&#8221; she said as she dragged her agent on stage and warned him &#8220;next time read the script first.&#8221;

What a great sense of style!
