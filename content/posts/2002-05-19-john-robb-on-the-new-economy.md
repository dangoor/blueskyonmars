John Robb, COO of Userland, wrote a [good essay on what he thinks the shape of the New Economy is][1]. I agree with what he says: the New Economy is indeed new, and it empowers individuals. One thing that I wonder, though: when the New Economy is no longer new, will corporations and corporate profits be the name of the game again?
