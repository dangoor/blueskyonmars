I&#8217;m not exactly sure how it is that I&#8217;ve never heard of this before. Maybe I have, but it didn&#8217;t make enough impression on me back then. [MusicBrainz][1] provides audio file metadata (somewhat like the CDDB), but it does it based on an acoustic fingerprint. The artist/song name/album name tags on my music tend to be of good quality already, but it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to do a run-through and cleanup. For the Mac, there&#8217;s [IEatBrainz][2] to clean up your iTunes library.

All this talk of brains [is making me hungry][3]. ðŸ™‚
