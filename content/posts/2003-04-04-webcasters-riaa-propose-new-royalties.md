[Webcasters, RIAA propose new royalties][1] &#8211; _The Digital Media Association and the Recording Industry Association of America agree to a proposal for royalty fees that Net radio services must pay record companies._ [[CNet][2]] I still don&#8217;t understand how webcasting is different from broadcast radio. In broadcast radio, the RIAA makes **nothing**. The broadcasters pay to BMI who distributes the money amongst songwriters. Paying 7 cents per webcast song seems outrageous.
