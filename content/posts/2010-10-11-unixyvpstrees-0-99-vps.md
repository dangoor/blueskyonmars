[A $0.99 per month VPS?][1]

> Yes, it is here and ROCKING! For **USD$0.99 per month**, you can get your own virtual private server (VPS) for LIFE

Only 5GB disk space and 20GB of data transfer, but it&#8217;s $12 a year! Holy cow. Not sure how much you can stuff into 64MB of RAM, but I&#8217;d imagine you could fit a cute little node app in that.
