Though it was publicly displayed a couple of days before, I announced the release of TurboGears on September 17, 2005: [Blue Sky On Mars Â» Blog Archive Â» Announcing TurboGears web megaframework (Python)][1].

Thanks again to everyone who has made TurboGears a successful and fun open source project!
