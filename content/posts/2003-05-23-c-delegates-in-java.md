Here is a way to get [something like C# Delegates in Java][1]. A delegate is basically an object representing a bound method. I didn&#8217;t realize that C# had this, and it&#8217;s a very nice feature that I wish Java had. The implementation the authors have done is pretty good, but it would be nice to have the same kind of syntactic sugar that C# provides here. Maybe J2SE 1.6?
