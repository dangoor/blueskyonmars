Though I&#8217;m not familiar with her music, I find [Janis Ian&#8217;s article about music downloading][1] very interesting. Reading an artists take on this is interesting, because the record companies claim to be trying to protect the interests of artists. Janis doesn&#8217;t think so, and I&#8217;m sure there are numerous others who agree with her.
