Seth Godin, a guy who certainly seems to know a thing or two about marketing, has put together a great ebook called  [99 cows][1]. It highlights 99 different things you can see on the net that represent innovative marketing. The book itself is a good example, because he&#8217;s allowing people to email it and post it on the web, and is giving away any proceeds that Amazon pulls in from the &#8220;official&#8221; ebook.
