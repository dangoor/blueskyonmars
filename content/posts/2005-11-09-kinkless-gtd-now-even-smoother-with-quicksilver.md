I&#8217;ve been a [Quicksilver][1] fan for a while now, and I&#8217;m a recent convert to [Kinkless GTD][2] which uses OmniOutliner to implement the Getting Things Done style of, well, getting things done. This morning, I updated to the latest version and learned about a new feature: you can add new items to your KGTD inbox via Quicksilver!

If you&#8217;ve never used Quicksilver, it&#8217;s hard to imagine how speedy it can make things. With this Quicksilver action, as soon as something pops into my head I can just hit control-space, &#8220;.&#8221;, type in the thing that I need to remember for later, tab, kg, enter. It&#8217;s amazingly quick and unobtrusive and lets me store everything away so that I can process it later, GTD-style.

By the way, for the Python folks reading this, Quicksilver actions can be written in Python!

I&#8217;ll repeat my earlier calls: if you happen to know of something like Quicksilver for Windows (and you&#8217;d really only know if you&#8217;ve tried Quicksilver on a Mac), let me know. It&#8217;s painful to not have it whenever I&#8217;m using my Windows machine.
