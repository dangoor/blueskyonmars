This past week&#8217;s MichiPUG meeting was fun and interesting (thanks, Stephan!), but the topic was not entirely Python newbie friendly. PyPy and Stackless are cool, but they are not mainstream.

For the June meeting (June 7 at 7PM, back at Arbor Networks), Carsten Haese will be giving a talk on a topic that is definitely mainstream: Python&#8217;s DBAPI. The DBAPI is like Java&#8217;s JDBC. It&#8217;s a database independent way to connect to databases and run queries.
