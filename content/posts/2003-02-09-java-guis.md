Through some strange turn, I suddenly found myself reading about Java GUI programming. I&#8217;ve been considering writing a small, fun program and debating about doing it in Java or Python. Python has some advantages: smaller memory footprint and runtime size, faster development time, more fun :), wxPython provides native look and feel. Java has some advantages over Python: huge collections of libraries that are fairly well structured, Eclipse IDE, GCJ to compile to native executable (apparently not for Windows yet). It&#8217;s that last one that&#8217;s the kicker. Generally, I&#8217;m a fan of native widgets, because I want my programs to look like Windows programs if they&#8217;re running under Windows. Swing does this to an extent, but SWT/JFace actually uses native widgets, just like wxPython. GCJ cannot compile Swing apps yet, but you can compile [SWT apps using GCJ][1].

A biased [comparison of Swing and SWT][2] by a Sun employee. Though it may be biased, there are some good points.
  
IBM DeveloperWorks also has an article about [using GCJ to compile Java apps to native code][3]
