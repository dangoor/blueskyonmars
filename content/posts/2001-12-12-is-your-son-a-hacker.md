Adequacy has a post with some tips on determining [if your son is a hacker][1]. This is hilarious reading. I have a hard time determining if it&#8217;s serious. (The fact that the original author followed it up in the comments below leads me to believe that it may actually be. I&#8217;m not sure whether that makes it funnier or scary.)
