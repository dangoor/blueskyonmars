In the [Slashdot interview of Lindows&#8217; Michael Robertson,][1] Michael said:

> The Xbox is Microsoft&#8217;s first attempt at a closed architecture PC. What they learn from the Xbox will be in their next generation closed desktop PC system. 

This is an interesting statement, because Microsoft is apparently [working with HP][2] on what sounds like a &#8220;closed desktop PC system&#8221;. Though $99/year may sound expensive, Michael&#8217;s goals of pushing the state of the art in desktop environments are certainly worthy. Note that I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;Linux desktop environments&#8221;. I think that ClickNRun packaging of software is a nice service that has no parallel.
