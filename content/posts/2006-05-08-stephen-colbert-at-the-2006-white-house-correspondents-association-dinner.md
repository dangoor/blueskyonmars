Wikipedia has a great article about [Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents&#8217; Association Dinner][1]. The reaction to Colbert&#8217;s routine from the media is interesting, because Colbert was definitely roasting the media in addition to the President. But, this is the age of the net. Even if the mainstream media decides not to talk about Colbert&#8217;s speech or show actual funny clips, millions have already caught the video online.
