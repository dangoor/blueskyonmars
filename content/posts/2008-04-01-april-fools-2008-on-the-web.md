[Gruber][1] wants to be a spoil sport by linking to [Your April Fools Day Joke Continues to Suck][2]. While I admit that the old &#8220;I changed my stylesheet to someone else&#8217;s&#8221; joke isn&#8217;t that funny any more, I do enjoy the bit of weird stuff that shows up on April 1. Maybe it&#8217;s not laugh out loud funny, but it brings a smile to my face, and I&#8217;m sure it does the same for others. So, I say bring it on!

The best joke I&#8217;ve seen so far is from Tim Ferriss, author of [&#8220;The 4-Hour Workweek&#8221;][3]. If you&#8217;re not familiar with Tim or his book, you probably won&#8217;t get the joke. If you are familiar with Tim and &#8220;personal outsourcing&#8221;, you should check out: [The Grand Illusion: The Real Tim Ferriss Speaks][4]

The funniest one that I&#8217;ve seen so far is that uk.youtube.com is [rickrolling][5] people with all of the Featured Videos.

The annual Google main joke was [Virgle][6], a joint venture between Virgin and Google to colonize Mars. Nice graphics. Not absurd enough to be hysterically funny, but good for a little entertainment.

A better joke from Google comes from Google Australia: [gDay MATE][7] technology that lets you search 1 day into the future.

Google Calendar has a [Wake Up Kit][8], but even better&#8230; they&#8217;ve added an **&#8220;I&#8217;m Feeling Lucky&#8221;** but to the appointment scheduling dialog. Click it, and you schedule a date with a celebrity!

Also better than the main joke: [Gmail Custom Time][9] (choose the time that the message should have been sent). Hmm&#8230; search in the future, mail in the past. Cool!

ThinkGeek has the awesome [Betamax to HD-DVD Converter][10] [among other April 1 products][11].

Google is credited with releasing [GWT for JavaScript 2][12], which uses the existing GWT widgets and compiles JavaScript 2 to cross-browser JavaScript. This is actually not so far fetched (Olav Junker KjÃ¦r has written a [JavaScript 2->traditional JS translator][13]), but such a thing is also not likely to get much traction.

Not an April Fools joke, but amazing nonetheless, a BBC commercial about [flying migratory penguins][14] with footage that looks straight out of Planet Earth.
