Alberto Valverde, TurboGears&#8217; current fearless leader, made an announcement a few days back about some changes that have quickened TG&#8217;s pace of development: [Update on the status of TG][1]. Open source projects _can_ take a considerable amount of time and energy that can be hard to sustain, depending on what is going on in your life. I certainly saw that with various contributors to TurboGears. People would come and go as they needed to.

Alberto detected that he needed more help to push through with all of the new developments in the project and he has it in the form of three dedicated folks. Florent Aide will maintain TurboGears 1.x and has done a lot of work bringing patches in and getting things ready for release. Mark Ramm is leading the TurboGears 2 charge, which is some very exciting development. And Chris Arndt has stepped up as the new sysadmin for the TurboGears.org websites, a place where we really needed some help.

These three positions are, of course, in addition to all of the folks who contribute code, docs and discussion to the project. It&#8217;s great to see TurboGears continuing to be so vibrant and interesting as it approaches its second birthday!
