Don Shelkey, the author of [Enforceability of EULA&#8217;s][1] [1] _is_ a lawyer (not providing legal advice, of course). This article provides a quick review of how the courts have viewed End User License Agreements. It appears that in many cases, a click-through license agreement is enforceable as a contract. Good to know if you&#8217;re either clicking through, or creating/choosing a EULA for your software.

This still leaves the GPL untested. Given that there&#8217;s no &#8220;consideration&#8221; for GPLed software, and that you generally don&#8217;t even clickthrough and many GPLed packages, the GPL will probably still have its day in court.
