Despite having MT-Blacklist installed and religiously purging evil comment spam, I&#8217;ve still been getting a fair amount of it. It can be a pain to get rid of (particularly when I get a raftload of comment spams). I have installed James Seng&#8217;s SCode plugin, which requires entry of a security code that is displayed in an image. I suspect this will completely eliminate my comment spam. I understand the trouble these pose for the blind. Luckily, there is a simple workaround (and I list it right next to the captcha). If you cannot see the image, just send me an email message and I will make sure your comment makes it up there. It&#8217;s not perfect, but I don&#8217;t want to have to take time out of my day to blast comment spam.
