Courtney Love famously had a falling out with her old record label and had plenty to say about [economics of major labe contracts][1]. Billboard interviewed her and asked her [why she signed with Virgin][2] instead of an indie:
  
<blockqutoe>I am not against majors. I am against two things &#8212; major-label accounting practices (which are addressed in my deal) and the rise of what I call &#8220;executive culture,&#8221; e.g.: where the executives are more important than the artists and where the ego of a president, no matter how nuts or crazy that president is, is more important than dozens and dozens of careers &#8230; Virgin has a culture where you don&#8217;t hear the names of the executives more often than the artists. This is really important to me.</blockquote> 

Lots of interesting perspective in this article, including bits about how she thinks she should have spent more on lobbyists than paying lawyers to fight in court.
