[Super Size Me][1] is the documentary created by a guy who ate nothing but McDonald&#8217;s food for a month:

> Within a few days of beginning his drive-through diet, Spurlock, 33, was vomiting out the window of his car, and doctors who examined him were shocked at how rapidly Spurlock&#8217;s entire body deteriorated.

This seems amazingly obvious, particularly because he was probably _trying_ to eat unhealthy food. Tell ya what&#8230; try another experiment. Spend 30 days eating nothing but Wendy&#8217;s (assuming he&#8217;s too sick of McD to go back there), and have nothing but salads (with low fat dressing) and grilled chicken. I&#8217;ll bet he comes out a lot better in the end, and I bet he could do the same at McDonald&#8217;s.

Having unhealthy food is always fun from time to time, but eating obviously unhealthy food frequently is just plain dumb.
