[New Scientist Planet Science: CREATURES FROM PRIMORDIAL][1]: _&#8220;Even though the circuit consists of only a small number of basic components, the researcher, Adrian Thompson, does not know how it works. He can&#8217;t ask the designer because there wasn&#8217;t one. Instead, the circuit evolved from a &#8220;primordial soup&#8221; of silicon components guided by the principles of genetic variation and survival of the fittest.&#8221;_ Wow! This kind of technology could completely alter the landscape of computing.
