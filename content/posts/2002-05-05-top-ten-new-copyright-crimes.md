LawMeme brings us the [Top Ten New Copyright Crimes][1] as a means of mocking Turner Broadcasting&#8217;s Jamie Kellner who stated that skipping commercials is theft. This article is also nice, because the author highlights some choice quotes from Kellner. It also has that great Heinlein quote that&#8217;s been floating around a lot lately. Heinlein said that there is nothing in law that states that just because something has been making money is guaranteed to continue. Face it, Hollywood: the Net and PVRs are disruptive technology. The sooner you figure out realistic business models, the sooner you&#8217;ll be able to reap the rewards of offering something consumers want.
