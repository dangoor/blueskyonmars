Tim Bray investigates the monetary implications of [his experiment with Google&#8217;s AdSense program][1]:

> Which is nothing that you&#8217;re going to retire on, but it would certainly cover the site&#8217;s costs and buy a couple of beers. And if you could drive the hits up, you could actually generate noticeable income.

Tim has a fairly busy site, but it looks like he could get several hundred a month from Google&#8217;s AdSense. At present, Google&#8217;s general policy is to not allow blogs, so I couldn&#8217;t sign up. I don&#8217;t do this blog for cash anyhow. But it&#8217;s interesting to think of what some sites that [are trying to make a profit][2] could do with this.
