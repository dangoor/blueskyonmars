I&#8217;m pleased to announce the first alpha release of TurboGears 0.9. This release has been long in coming, but there&#8217;s a lot that&#8217;s new. This release includes &#8220;widgets&#8221; for working with forms easily, the Toolbox (including the CatWalk database model browser) set of browser-based development tools, internationalization, revamped and hugely improved error handling, and an identity framework for out-of-the-box authentication/authorization. There are _many_ improvements to TurboGears in this release. Take a look at the [changelog][1].

This release is essentially feature-complete. I&#8217;m calling it an alpha because there are still a number of bugs to correct and the documentation needs a lot of updates and enhancements. For people who have been running TurboGears out of svn, you now have a more stable base to work from.

Many thanks to the members of the TurboGears core team, and the 40+ people who adding things large and small to this release!
