When working with large source trees, [JQuery][1] can be a big help.

> JQuery is a flexible, query-based source code browser, developed as an Eclipse plug-in. After selecting a java working set of interest, a JQuery user can define his or her own top-level queries (or &#8220;browsers&#8221;) on-the-fly by formulating logic queries and running them against his/her source code. Alternatively, the user can choose from a variety of pre-written browsers, and use as-is or modify to suit their specific needs. Individual elements in the tree can then be queried individually in the same fasion. The user can specify how query results are organized in the hierarchical tree viewer using a simple variables editor interface.

Last week, I was reading through quite a bit of other people&#8217;s code&#8230; Had I but known about JQuery then!
