In addition to starting my new job at Arbor Networks (which is going quite well, by the way), I&#8217;ve been working hard on the TurboGears book ever since returning from EuroPython. This has left me with little time to blog, and I didn&#8217;t have my work machine set up for blog posting (which is to say that I forgot my password because I never have to type it), so I couldn&#8217;t even link to interesting things.

I&#8217;ve fixed my blog posting problem. The next step will be to fix my blogging itself. I don&#8217;t have time to comment on these things properly, but I do know that I want to comment on them:

Bruce Eckel wrote about [TurboGears at his Web Framework Jam][1]. I&#8217;m excited to see this, because I&#8217;ve been a fan of Bruce&#8217;s writing for several years.

And I&#8217;m quite tardy in replying to Steve Holden&#8217;s [excellent notes and commentary about my web track keynote][2] at EuroPython. Sorry about that, Steve!
