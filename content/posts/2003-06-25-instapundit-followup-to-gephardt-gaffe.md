Glenn posted a good collection of quotes and comments on [Dick Gephardt&#8217;s now infamous &#8220;executive order&#8221; statement][1]. I agree with the quote in there that if you criticize Ashcroft for making statements that are at odds with the Constitution, you should criticize Gephardt as well. Gephardt&#8217;s spokesperson, not surprisingly, backpedaled on the statement saying that Gephardt essentially just meant that he would use the tools of his office in his commitment to diversity. But the statement itself and the context in which it was made certainly sound like he actually thought, at that time, that an executive order could undo a decision from the Court.
