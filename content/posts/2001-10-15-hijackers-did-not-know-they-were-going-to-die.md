The FBI has concluded [that 11 of the hijackers did not know they were going to their deaths][1]. Granted, there is no way to know this for sure, because the first hand witnesses are dead. But, the information at hand does seem to point to the terrorists following a &#8220;need to know&#8221; policy of information dissemination.
