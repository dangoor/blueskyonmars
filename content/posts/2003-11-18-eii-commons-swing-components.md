Among the postings in the java.net thread that I was just talking about, there was a reference to [EII Commons][1] which provides:

>   * a sortable table model and corresponding sortable JTable
>   * a set of masked edit controls
>   * a wizard framework (i.e. &#8220;< Back&#8221;, &#8220;Next >&#8221;, &#8220;Finish&#8221;, &#8220;Cancel&#8221;) 
>   * an Eclipse-like view framework for Swing 
>   * various tree, table, and list utilities 
>   * miscellaneous utilities such as:
>   * a resource loader (loads images and other resources relative to a class)
>   * a class that will copy an InputStream to an OutputStream, or a Reader to a Writer
>   * a class-based processor repository that dynamically delegates
  
>     to some sort of processor based on the &#8220;best fit&#8221; for an object&#8217;s class
