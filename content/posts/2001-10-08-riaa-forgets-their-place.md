The Register brings us an [article about the RIAA&#8217;s desire for tougher laws][1]. It&#8217;s written in The Register&#8217;s typical, biased style&#8230; but the quotes in the article speak for themselves. _We&#8217;ll leave the last, chilling word to Sony Music Entertainment&#8217;s Steve Heckler: &#8220;Once consumers can no longer get free music, they will have to buy the music in the formats we choose to put out.&#8221;_ My comment to Steve Heckler: consumers don&#8217;t have to buy anything.
