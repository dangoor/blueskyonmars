[Shaking our faith in Google][1] &#8211; _<a name="When:3:07:56AM">DaveNet: <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2003/04/11/shakingOurFaithInGoogle">Shaking our faith in Google</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/11#When:3:07:56AM" title="Permanent link to this item in archive."></a></i> [<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/">Scripting News</a>] Dave writes about Google&#8217;s SafeSearch filters and how they can catch some pages that are not prurient in nature.<br /> <!--more-->

<br /> This is a non-issue. All content filters produced to date are imprecise. If that&#8217;s a problem for you, turn off SafeSearch. Since Google tends to return relevant results, you&#8217;ll generally get &#8220;clean&#8221; results to your searches anyhow&#8230;</p>
