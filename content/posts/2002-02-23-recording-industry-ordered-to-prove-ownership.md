In an interesting turn in the Napster case, [Judge Patel has ordered the record companies to prove their ownership of the music copyrights][1]. Napster has accused the RIAA&#8217;s members of anticompetitive behavior, saying that they would not license the music to online delivery services other than their own. Judge Patel is taking this charge seriously, and this could lead to a pretty significant ruling down the road&#8230;
