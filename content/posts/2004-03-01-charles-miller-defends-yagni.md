It turns out that there&#8217;s no need for me to ever write up a good defense of the &#8220;you&#8217;re not going to need it&#8221; strategy, because [Charles Miller has already done so][1]. Sure, nothing applies 100% of the time, but more often than not I think that YAGNI is the right strategy to use.
