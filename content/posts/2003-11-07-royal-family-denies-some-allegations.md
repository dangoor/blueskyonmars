The British royal family is always the top thing for the tabloids over there, but this story: [Yahoo! News &#8211; Britain Agog Over What Charles &#8216;Didn&#8217;t Do&#8217;][1] is a bit surreal:

> &#8220;I just want to make it entirely clear, even though I can&#8217;t refer to the specifics of the allegation, that it&#8217;s totally untrue and without a shred of substance,&#8221; Sir Michael Peat said.

Wow! What a statement! Coming out and making a statement like that makes people even more curious what these &#8220;totally untrue&#8221; allegations are all about. Perhaps the British media frenzy had gotten to the point where such a statement _had_ to be made&#8230; but, from where I&#8217;m sitting, it just seems like they&#8217;re drawing more attention to themselves.
