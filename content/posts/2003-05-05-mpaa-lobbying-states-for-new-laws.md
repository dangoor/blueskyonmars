The San Francisco Chronicle&#8217;s article [Heading off film piracy / Movie trade group staying one step ahead in lobbying efforts][1] talks about how the MPAA is getting state legislatures to pass new laws with tougher anti-piracy restraints. Don&#8217;t let them fool you. Copyright infringement is already illegal and these new laws do nothing other than restrict consumer choice. Also, don&#8217;t let the MPAA&#8217;s lobbying muscle dissuade you from taking a stand here. The state legislators are there to serve _you_ and they need your votes to win. Unless you&#8217;re in California, the motion picture industry will not have a hold on the votes in your area.
