Justin Davis has just announced that [Christophe de Vienne][1] is the new maintainer of the TurboGears Web Services (TGWS) project. Thank you Christophe for carrying this project forward! I consider it a good sign for a project&#8217;s health when it can make the transition between maintainers, which is something both TurboGears and TGWS have done.

[TGWS][2], if you&#8217;re not familiar with it, is a multiprotocol web services extension for TurboGears 1.
