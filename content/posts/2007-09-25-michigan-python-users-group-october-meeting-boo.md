The October meeting of the [Michigan Python Users Group][1] is coming up next week. Thursday, October 4 at 7PM, once again at SRT Solutions&#8217; office in downtown Ann Arbor.

This month, Jay Wren is going to be giving a talk about Boo, a very heavily Python-inspired language for .NET/mono. Though it&#8217;s not Python, I asked Jay to give this talk because Boo looks a lot like Python, but it&#8217;s statically typed (!) and incorporates some other .NET specific features. 

It only just now occurred to me that having Boo as a topic for October is doubly appropriate, though the 4th is still a bit away from Halloween.
