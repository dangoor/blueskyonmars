Cedric has released [TestNG 1.0!][1]. It&#8217;s very good to see activity in this area, and I think the annotations approach seems like a good one. Though I am likely to be using Java 1.5 soon, I plan to really give TestNG a try until after there is an Eclipse plugin. I&#8217;m too used to Control-F11, look for the green bar, move on&#8230;
