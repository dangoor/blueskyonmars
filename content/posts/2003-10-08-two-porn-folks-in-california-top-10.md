California Governor Gray Davis has officially been recalled. Looking at the results for the candidates to succeed him, it is clear that <a title="CA Secretary of State - Statewide Special - Candidates to succeed GRAY DAVIS   
as Governor if he is recalled: &#8211; Statewide&#8221; href=&#8221;http://vote2003.ss.ca.gov/Returns/gov/00.htm&#8221;>Arnold Schwarzenegger is the new governor of California</a>. It is also interesting to see _Hustler_ publisher Larry Flynt at number 7 and porn actress Mary Carey (aka Mary Cook) at number 10. Gary Coleman did not disappoint, showing up at number 8. Even Gallagher, the watermelon-smashing comedian managed to place 16th. Shows how far name recognition can get you.

Of course, there are only so many votes around and the top 3 candidates scooped up 93.6% of them, so it&#8217;s not like Larry Flynt was even close to becoming governor of California. It&#8217;s just an amusingly crazy election.
