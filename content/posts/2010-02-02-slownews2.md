## Apple iPad: Open _and_ Closed

Obviously, the iPad was introduced this past weekend and probably a million words or more about it have spilled out onto the net. Here&#8217;s just a few of those words.

Yehuda Katz takes the open side in [&#8220;A GREAT Day for Open Technologies&#8221;][1]. Actually, Yehuda takes _both_ sides. Apple has created a closed platform while at the same time creating a very powerful platform for the Open Web. The trouble is that if you view the iPad as the future of computing, it is a scary thought as a geek to work on a platform that is so closed off. That&#8217;s more of [Peter Kim&#8217;s take][2].

Personally, I agree with stevenf&#8217;s take that [the iPad is the &#8220;new world&#8221; of computing][3], and it&#8217;s really a better world for most users. But, it&#8217;s only &#8220;new world 1.0&#8221;. It requires another computer. It can&#8217;t print. I believe that Apple is going to create a Time Capsule sort of device to which you can dock iPhones and iPads without needing a full computer, because an iPad is a full-enough computer for most people. For now, though, iPad is going to start making its way in the world as that &#8220;third device&#8221; that Steve Jobs referred to upon introducing it.

Mark Pilgrim and I apparently had similar tracks to learning computers (though mine was a TRS-80 Model III, not an Apple ][). He worries that [future tinkerers will be left in the cold][4] because of devices like iPads. There&#8217;s a huge difference between now and a couple decades ago. Computers were _all_ for tinkerers then. Computers are for everyone now. I think there will remain ways for people to tinker.

## iPad SDK: No Multitasking, New Shared Files

MacRumors has a [quick rundown of the new iPad SDK][5]. It has support for external displays (for Keynote, I&#8217;d imagine). No multitasking is supported. There&#8217;s a new shared filesystem, which is presumed to be the way to get iWork documents onto the tablet. There&#8217;s also said to be support for apps that support both iPad and iPhone, which should be interesting.

## zeromq: Very Lightweight Messaging

Martin Sustrik and Martin Lucina have written an article about zeromq ([&#8220;a new approach to messaging&#8221;][6]), which looks to be about as minimal a messaging system as you can imagine. It&#8217;s got an API that&#8217;s patterned after BSD sockets. The comments that follow the article are quite interesting and useful as well. There&#8217;s a comparison of zeromq, AMQP and [RestMS][7] and the different kinds of things those are good at. RestMS actually sounds quite interesting to me. I&#8217;ll need to read a bit more about [Zyre][8], which is a RestMS implementation.

## ScriptCommunicator: Long Polling for Every Browser

Amir from Plurk has created a small (80 lines) module ([ScriptCommunicator][9]) for doing long polling, regardless of the browser. Even if real time isn&#8217;t right for everything (this is SlowNews after all), Comet is quite important and this little library deals with some of the tricky bits for one style of Comet.

## (fab): A DSL for async coding with node.js

[fab][10] will likely remind people of Lisp, because of all of the parentheses. Look more closely, and you&#8217;ll notice that the parens are not nested&#8230; because this is proper JS, and fab is working through function call chaining. The goal of fab was to provide a nice way to define how URLs get handled in a node.js-powered web app. It&#8217;s a neat idea and the result is reasonably clean.

## gccgo is Official

GCC 4.5 is slated to include Go. It will be interesting to see when Go-based projects actually start appearing, and when the first Go-based &#8220;killer app&#8221; arrives on the scene (think of what CouchDB and RabbitMQ have done for Erlang, for example).

## 75% of Linux Code is Written by Paid People

Over the years, I have seen a number of people characterize open source as [written by &#8220;hobbyists&#8221;][11]. That isn&#8217;t actually a derogatory thing to say, because people volunteering their time to a project that they believe in and love will likely do it well and with gusto. But, I&#8217;ve always thought that the view of hobbyist-driven open source is not the likely picture for large and successful open source projects. Jonathan Corbet analyzed Linux kernel contributions across 2009 and found that [75% of the code came from people who were being paid][12] to write that code.

Creating a significant open source project can be at least a full time job. For something like Linux, it&#8217;s obviously _many_ full time jobs.

## toppcloud: Easy, Reliable Cloud Deployment

The prolific Ian Bicking has just [spread word of toppcloud][13]. He&#8217;s been mentioning it on twitter for a while, but now he gives the full story. If you have to deploy server side code (and don&#8217;t mind using Ubuntu on your VPS), check out toppcloud as a way to potentially make things easier.

## Hot Code Reloading for node.js

Blaine Cook has a branch of node.js that can [hot reload modules][14]. This is obviously great in both development and production, when implemented well.

## A zsh Prompt That Understands Hg, Git, Mac Batteries

Steve Losh has created a seriously [tricked out zsh prompt][15].

## CommonJS: The First Year

CommonJS turned a year old this past week, and I wrote a [retrospective on that first year][16]. Short form: JavaScript is growing fast!

## Geek Conversation Killers

Philip Guo has an interesting article about [awkwardness of &#8220;geeks&#8221; in conversation][17]. I have definitely both witnessed this and caught myself doing some of these things. If you&#8217;re a geek like me, put a few brain cells onto the task of watching for these things during your next conversation. Calley Soukup has an [interesting collection of observations][18] about how sci-fi fans communicate, dating back to 1999.

## Feedback for SlowNews #1

[&#8220;very promising debut!!!&#8221;][19] @uhop

&#8220;[Hypocrite.][20] The article was posted _today_. Let&#8217;s see if it&#8217;s still here 24 months from now in the same form.&#8221; lutusp on reddit. _Ed: this is odd, everyone has to start with a thought sometime. I&#8217;m pretty sure that in two years I&#8217;m still going to think that real time flow of random news is a bad thing._
