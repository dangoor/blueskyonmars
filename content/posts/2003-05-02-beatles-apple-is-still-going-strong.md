I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s particularly well known, but Apple Corp. is the name of the Beatles&#8217; company. According to Macworld, [the Beatles&#8217; Apple still a strong force in music world][1]. Apple Computer was sued in 1989 for trademark infringement, paid some cash and was told to stay out of the music business. With Apple Computer&#8217;s new iTunes Music Store, they&#8217;re clearly not staying out of the business. I&#8217;m pretty sure they would have worked out the legal ramifications of that by now&#8230;
