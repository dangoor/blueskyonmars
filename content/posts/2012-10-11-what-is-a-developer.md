My goal as a product manager at Mozilla is to represent the needs of web developers well and make sure that Mozilla is doing what we can to help them.

I came to the realization last night that when I talk with others about what &#8220;developers&#8221; need, the picture of that &#8220;developer&#8221; that appears in different people&#8217;s minds can be quite different from my own. In fact, while I may imagine someone sitting at a keyboard getting frustrated at trying to make something work, someone else may be thinking of a _company_ that &#8220;wants&#8221; to get an app into Mozilla&#8217;s [Marketplace][1].

In my view, when you&#8217;re figuring out what you need to build, imagining a company is almost always not what you want. Companies don&#8217;t _do_ anything. People do. People have a variety of reasons for doing the things they do, and understanding what those people are trying to accomplish is key to building good products.

This is what I like about [personas][2] [<sup>[1]</sup>][3]{#refmark-1.fn-ref-mark}. Personas describe realistic people, allowing you to empathize with them and ensuring that you&#8217;d never mistake a person for a company. They can help give clarity to which things are important to build and also help catch gaps. Imagine a coworker coming up to you and saying &#8220;Can you believe I just met someone who was trying to make our product [do something outlandish]?&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible that the person in question is an outlier that you can safely ignore. But, it&#8217;s also possible that there are other, similar people out there and adding a new persona to the mix may open up a whole new market.

All of that said, it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable in many contexts to talk about a company as a &#8220;developer&#8221;. &#8220;Mozilla is the developer of the popular Firefox web browser&#8221;, for example. There are certainly times in product development where talking about a developer as the entity that controls an app in the Marketplace is perfectly reasonable. But, when you get down to planning features, I think it pays to think about individual people.
