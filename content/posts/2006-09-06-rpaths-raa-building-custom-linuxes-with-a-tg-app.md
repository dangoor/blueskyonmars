Another TurboGears-based product [showed up on Digg][1] a few days ago (I&#8217;m a bit tardy in blogging this one, sorry!) [RPath makes a great-sounding tool][2] for building custom Linux distributions for appliances. Linux is a great embedded platform for medium to large devices, depending on your requirements, and RAA lets you get your Linux in shape easily so that you can focus on your application (might I suggest that TurboGears is a good way to make the UI for your app? :). You can read more at [Joseph Tate&#8217;s blog][3].
