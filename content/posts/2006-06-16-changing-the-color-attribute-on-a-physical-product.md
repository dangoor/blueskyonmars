Remarkably, all of the timings fell into place for me to begin shipping the [TurboGears Ultimate DVD][1] (and the assorted other fun stuff I&#8217;ve got) today as planned. Producing the DVD was a painful experience that was fraught with peril (but mostly fraught with an extraordinary variety of technical complications). It was a good feeling to get it off to manufacturing.

The DVDs arrived on schedule at the warehouse on Wednesday, and I received a few yesterday. It looks fantastic, except&#8230; I had wanted the G-gear on a shiny disc instead of on white. Remarkably, duplication company&#8217;s software lets you specify (and pay for) the shiny &#8220;feature&#8221; and yet still have it turned off for the production process. Hmm&#8230; two variables representing the same information&#8230; what could possibly go wrong?

Sadly, you can&#8217;t just twiddle the color flag on a physical product. I was actually close to being sold out of discs anyhow, so I turned it into a win for everyone. I got discount on the white discs and a batch of shiny discs will be zooming to the warehouse soon.

I really want to give preorder supporters first dibs on the cooler, shiny discs. So, I&#8217;m planning to start shipping the preorders next week when the shiny ones arrive at the warehouse. If you&#8217;d rather not wait the extra couple of days, just send me an email (kid -at- blazingthings.com), and I&#8217;ll send you a white one right away.
