I spotted a TypePad blog that had these nice URLs with the posting title spelled out and I thought, why don&#8217;t I have that? Well, it turns out that [it&#8217;s really easy to set up][1]. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s not the default.

Anyhow, I have friendlier URLs for individual postings now. At the moment, my permalinks are still pointing to a day&#8217;s postings rather than individual postings&#8230; I find that this brings in commentary for a wider variety of my postings. I have individual pages for the benefit of search engines. That kind of thing has made me one of the foremost authorities on [super volcanoes][2]. Blue Sky On Mars has also become the foremost [Dangoor][3], beating out dangoor.com.
