A couple days back, I posed the link to BugMeNot, a site which provides registration information for a significant number of websites. A newspaper industry person (not an official industry rep, I believe, but someone in the industry) had an interesting response: [Lockergnome &#8211; Windows Fanatics &#8211; June 8, 2004][1]. As also mentioned in this article, there are clearly plenty of sites that make money off of ads without obtrusive advertising. I didn&#8217;t mind the sites that asked me my age and zip code. That was quick and fine&#8230; doing yet another registration form is often more than I want to do for most sites. I did it for the NY Times, but I&#8217;m not going to do it for the Podunk Gazette.
