(via [slashdot][1]) This is hilarious. The only thing I can figure is that the scammers are trying to see the limits of gullibility: [Cosmic 419er lost in space][2]

> I am Dr. Bakare Tunde, the cousin of Nigerian Astronaut, Air Force Major Abacha Tunde. He was the first African in space when he made a secret flight to the Salyut 6 space station in 1979. He was on a later Soviet spaceflight, Soyuz T-16Z to the secret Soviet military space station Salyut 8T in 1989. He was stranded there in 1990 when the Soviet Union was dissolved.

And, of course, this Nigerian has amassed $15M in pay, of which you can get 20% if you help them out in bringing the guy back. Would anyone actually fall for that?
