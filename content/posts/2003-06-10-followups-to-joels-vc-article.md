Joel posted [a number of followups][1] to his earlier article about fixing what&#8217;s wrong with venture capital. These are worthwhile reading, too, to get the other perspective. One way to look at this (and this goes for musicians who are looking at recording contracts!), actually read the contract and don&#8217;t neglect the fine print.
