April Fools on the web is always a great deal of fun. This year, there were some good ones. My favorites (ranked in order):

  1. [Boring Boring][1] parody of [Boing Boing][2]
  2. [Google Gulp][3] brain enhancer
  3. My previously mentioned [Scientific American editors note][4] in which SciAm gives up.
  4. [43 Folders&#8217; April Power Hacks][5] from Merlin Mann
  5. [April Fools EFFector][6], the EFF gives their take on the state of the world via a nice bit of satire.
  6. [ScreenCleanerPro][7] as reviewed on MacWorld
  7. [Stricter Whitespace Enforcement][8] in Python 2.5
