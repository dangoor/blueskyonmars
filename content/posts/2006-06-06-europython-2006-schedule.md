The [Europython 2006][1] schedule is up and has what is, to me, an overwhelming amount of me. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to going there and meeting everyone, but it appears that I have an hour and forty minutes to prepare for! It wouldn&#8217;t be a big deal if I didn&#8217;t also need to work on a book this month and to earn a little money in between.
  
Seriously, if you&#8217;re a TurboGears user, heading to EuroPython and interested in taking on a TG segment, email me please.
