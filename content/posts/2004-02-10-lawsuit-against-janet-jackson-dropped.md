Just a few days [after the suit was filed][1], comes the news that the [woman has dropped her lawsuit over Jackson&#8217;s stunt][2].

> Less than a week after filing a class-action lawsuit because of her outrage over Janet Jackson &#8216;s Super Bowl stunt, Terri Carlin believes she&#8217;s made her point.

Is it because she thinks she&#8217;s made her point, or because it was a stupid lawsuit that would likely have dragged on for a lot of time, wasting her time, her lawyer&#8217;s time (which he apparently wasn&#8217;t billing for), and everyone else&#8217;s time?
