I&#8217;ve read only a little bit of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, so this is not really about the book. This is actually about \*receiving\* the book.

For some reason, I remember that Order of the Phoenix was shipped with special FedEx Saturday delivery. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if that was FedEx&#8217;s busiest Saturday ever. What made Amazon&#8217;s logistics for this book interesting is that UPS carried the book most of the way, and then \*delivered it to a post office\*. The postal service then delivered the book with the normal mail on Saturday. That makes a lot more sense, since the postal service always does Saturday deliveries.

It&#8217;s hard to imagine the coordination and exchange of money that had to happen for that. (The UPS shipping labels even said &#8220;Deliver to USPS&#8221; with another section that said &#8220;USPS please deliver to&#8221;&#8230;) But, Amazon almost certainly sold more than 500,000 preorders. With that kind of volume, you can probably get a bit of special handling.

The second thing is that I had noticed that Amazon had dropped their price on the book by $1 since the time when I preordered. I didn&#8217;t particularly care, but I was surprised to get an email in which Amazon said they were refunding the $1! That&#8217;s great customer service and a great way to make sure that people don&#8217;t feel like they&#8217;re getting burned for preordering.

Finally, I received an email today (Sunday) from Amazon saying that my book was on time and that I&#8217;d receive it by 7PM on Saturday. I&#8217;m not sure whose mailserver is at fault for that one.

All-in-all, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s nice to be able to place an order online and get it on release day and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll do the same for book 7.

(Reviews for Half-Blood Prince have been mixed, which is not really surprising. I think that&#8217;s been true of all of the books, with the possible exception of the Hugo winning Goblet of Fire.)
