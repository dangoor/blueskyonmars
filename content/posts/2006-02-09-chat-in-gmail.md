For many people, including me as of last night, Gmail now includes chat via Google Talk. And I must say that it&#8217;s very cool and nicely implemented. I tried a chat this morning (I was using Gmail&#8217;s web interface, he was using gaim) and it worked great. The amazing thing was that the chat transcript in my gmail account was updated live as we were talking. I did a search for a piece of mail and that chat showed up while we were still going.

It&#8217;s a very nice piece of integration, and it makes perfect sense.

Lately, I&#8217;ve been having a little trouble with Gmail becoming unresponsive. I considered downloading my Gmail to Apple Mail, but the Gmail interface is just **so** much better for threaded conversations. There&#8217;s enough of a difference that I&#8217;m willing to put up with a little downtime for the sake of the better UI. And I thought desktop apps were supposed to be better?
