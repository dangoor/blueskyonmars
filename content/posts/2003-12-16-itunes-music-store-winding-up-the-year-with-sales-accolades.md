I may have been a little skeptical when it was first launched, but Apple has had a great first year with the iTunes Music Store (iTMS). [No other music service has come close in sales.][1] Since the launch in April, Apple has sold [25 million songs][2]. AdAge picked Apple as [Marketer of the Year][3]. Time named iTMS [Invention of the Year][4]. Fortune called iTMS [Product of the Year][5].

Wow. That&#8217;s quite a year. I think that iTMS is a great product, but I agree with the criticisms about Apple&#8217;s &#8220;closed system&#8221;: iTMS songs only work on iPod and songs from other stores don&#8217;t work on the iPod. I&#8217;m guessing that Apple is playing this smart, though. Despite being cool, iTMS is _not_ a money maker; the iPod is. They&#8217;re going to hold on to their big market share as long as they can. Will they open up if market pressures force them to? Hard to say. They&#8217;ve been clinging on to single-digit percentages of the desktop market share for a long time&#8230; maybe they&#8217;ll be happy with a small slice of the pie as the pie grows.
