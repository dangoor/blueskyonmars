The Washington Post has an article focused on [Washington region of ClearChannel][1], the massive radio/concert/billboard company. It provides a good insight into how ClearChannel works and why everything you hear sounds the same. Here in Detroit, we still have 89X modern rock out of Windsor and 96.3 WDVD which plays mainstream music, but is not focused on current Top 40.
