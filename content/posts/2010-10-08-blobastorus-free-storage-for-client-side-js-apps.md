> **[blobastor.us][1]** is a free data storage service that is optimized for HTML5 web applications. The service is designed to be interfaced from javascript in the browser and to eliminate the need for a server component for most little HTML5 apps. Twitter is used to provide authentication and user identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Lloyd amped up an idea that Atul put forth just a few days back. 20K per user per domain of free storage for JSON blobs. Basically zero effort to store a little bit of data for purely client driven apps. Makes serverless coding in the cloud seem a little more reasonable, no?
