Jason Pellerin is going to be giving a talk about his [Nose][1] testing tool at the Michigan Python Users Group (MichiPUG). I&#8217;ve been a Nose users since the very beginning, so I&#8217;m happy that Jason himself is giving a talk on it.

As usual, the meeting is on the first Thursday of the month (March 6th, in this case) at 7PM. Meetings are always free.

And, as has been the case the past several months, [SRT Solutions][2] is going to be hosting the meeting at their perfect downtown Ann Arbor location. In addition to [the instructions on how to get to SRT][3], I&#8217;ll also mention that street parking is free after 6PM and usually readily available a couple blocks north at Ann and Fifth (right next to the City Hall/Police Station building).

Unfortunately, I most likely won&#8217;t see you there for this month&#8217;s meeting, as it&#8217;s kindergarten roundup time for Ann Arbor Schools and we&#8217;re trying to figure out the best kindergarten choice for our daughter. Hopefully, I will be seeing some of you at PyCon in a couple of weeks!
