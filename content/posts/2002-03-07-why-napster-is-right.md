I can&#8217;t believe I haven&#8217;t seen this article before. Michele Boldrin and UCLA Economics Professor David Levine wrote [Why Napster Is Right][1] which goes in to the economics of why intellectual property laws should go away in this age of dirt cheap distribution. I&#8217;ve generally been of the opinion that copyright laws are a good thing, but should have a much shorter lifespan than they currently do. This article is making me rethink whether copyright really is a good idea in the current age&#8230; Everything I&#8217;m interested in professionally (software, music, writing) is all based around intellectual property. So, it&#8217;s a big step to think that there may be another way.
