I figured that I&#8217;d start my articles about [Zesty News][1] off with a light, uncontroversial topic: where did the name come from?

The Zesty News name actually came to mind when the original idea did in mid-2003. I liked the sound of it, and it even has a nice, although generally food-related, [definition][2]: &#8220;marked by spirited enjoyment&#8221;. That&#8217;s the way keeping up with the goings on in the world should be.

So, you&#8217;d think that the story would end there. Unfortunately for me, it didn&#8217;t end there. When I started this new company, I was having a rough time coming up with a business name that had a .com address available. Anyone starting a business today will know what I&#8217;m talking about. It seems that almost every combination of words has been taken.

I ran through many [whois][3] queries and tried a number of [Nameboy][4] combinations. Nothing was striking me, until I finally hit upon [Blazing Things][5]. On January 1st, 2005, I registered blazingthings.com. It made sense to me at the time to have a tight branding connection between the product and the company. So, I registered blazingnews.com also, and that was the name that the software started out with.

[Kirsten][6], the graphics designer I&#8217;m working with, was just getting going on logo concepts when POW! In March, Go Daddy introduced a service called News Blazer. Blazing News and News Blazer were just too close for comfort. Hence the decision to bring back the Zesty News name.

In fact, the biggest reason that I announced the Zesty News software before I had the alpha test ready to ship was to get the [name out there][7]. I would have thought that Blazing News was a safe name until News Blazer came along.
