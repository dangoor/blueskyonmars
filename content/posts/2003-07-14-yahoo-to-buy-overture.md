[Yahoo to buy Overture for $1.63 billion][1]

> Ending months of speculation, Yahoo said Monday it&#8217;s buying online ad company Overture Services for $1.63 billion in stock and cash.

First, we see the stock of surviving dotcoms edging upward into overvalued-land, and maybe here comes the resumption of multi-billion dollar mergers. Actually, this merger makes good sense for Yahoo. As much as search engine purists hate the notion of paid search listings (which is what Overture offers), their system worked really well for me when I was running Byproducts.com.
