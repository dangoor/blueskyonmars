It&#8217;s been a good couple of weeks for automated functional testing tools. First, there was [Selenium][1] for webapps, and now there&#8217;s [Windows Application Test System Using Python (WATSUP)][2] for Windows applications. I&#8217;ve found that automated functional tests for anything with a GUI can be quite challenging, and these tools look like a good way to help.
