[End Run Around The Labels: Pat DiNizio Offers New Way To Distribute Music][1] &#8211; _n/a_ [[MTV News][2]] Here&#8217;s someone who&#8217;s actually working on bringing the future of music forward. DiNizio is the lead singer of the Smithereens. He&#8217;s looking for 100 patrons to sponsor his music at $1,200 each. For their $1,200 the patrons get 50 copies of a few albums (so that they can pass them out to friends), plus backstage passes to a Smithereens show, plus a &#8220;living room concert&#8221; for the patron and a few friends at the venue of their choice.

It&#8217;s a neat idea, and it&#8217;s great to see new business models like this being given a chance.
