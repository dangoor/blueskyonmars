[o3: The Open Source Enterprise Data Networking Magazine][1], a free, polished online magazine available in PDF form now has issue 5 up. Issue 5 has two articles about TurboGears: an introduction that I wrote, and an article about scaling by the guys at FrozenBear (creators of [diggdot.us][2]). Check it out! (And pay attention to the ads, if you&#8217;ve been thinking about the [TurboGears Ultimate DVD.][3])
