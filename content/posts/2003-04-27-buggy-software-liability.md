[CNN.com &#8211; Spread of buggy software raises new questions &#8211; Apr. 27, 2003][1] &#8211; While I think getting into product liability lawsuits for software will likely put a major dent in the industry, I do think that better software quality is not only possible but is _cheaper_. Test Driven Development, combined with other solid practices, has the power to reduce the number of defects in software and prevent the defects from coming back. There are a lot of people still developing software &#8220;the old fashioned way&#8221;, but I do think that TDD will only grow in popularity from where it is now.
