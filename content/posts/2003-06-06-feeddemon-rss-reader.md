I&#8217;m currently using [Amphetadesk][1] (with the outline plugin) as my RSS reader. That&#8217;s the best I&#8217;ve found so far. I want an RSS reader that uses as much &#8220;smarts&#8221; as possible to figure out what I might want to read. Ideally, content would not be separated by which blog it came from. [SharpReader][2] adds threading for related posts, which is an interesting idea. The forthcoming [FeedDemon][3] has an intriguing screenshot that shows a &#8220;newspaper-like&#8221; view, but still seems to be splitting based on source. I want something that&#8217;s like [Google News][4]. One integrated page that ties all of my news together.
