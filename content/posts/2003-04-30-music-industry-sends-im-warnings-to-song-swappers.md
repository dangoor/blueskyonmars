The [music biz sent IMs to thousands of song swappers][1] who had copyrighted songs available for download from their Grokster and Kazaa nodes. I greatly prefer the industry taking such technical steps to stop song swapping to taking legislative ones. Ultimately, I think the steps are pointless and the industry should really start giving people want they want. I don&#8217;t think free music is really what people are after&#8230; they&#8217;re after supporting the _musicians_ by buying music at reasonable prices. I don&#8217;t think the general public (myself included) cares very much about the industry middlemen.
