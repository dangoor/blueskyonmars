A federal appeals court rules that the [RIAA cannot subpoena an ISP for information about its users][1] based upon the provision in the DMCA. In other good news, [the Dutch Supreme Court has ruled that Kazaa is not responsible][2] for the actions of its users, paving the way for individual Dutch folk to get sued, just like they are here in the states!
