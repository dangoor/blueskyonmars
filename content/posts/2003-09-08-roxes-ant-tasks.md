ROXES has released a set of [three useful ant tasks][1] for putting the finishing touches and distributing your projects: sfx makes self-extracting archives, jstub makes a native executable wrapper, and jnlp simplifies the creation of Java Web Start JNLP files. jstub and sfx both support Windows, Mac OS X and any Unix variant.
