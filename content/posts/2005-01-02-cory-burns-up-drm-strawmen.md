Cory Doctorow shows [how it&#8217;s only sane to be concerned about DRM][1]. And not just because of today&#8217;s restrictions:

> If you are thinking about buying a stereo with a key feature and the choice is between two models, wouldn&#8217;t it be useful to know that in one model, the feature is guaranteed to last forever, while in the other, the feature can be revoked at any time due to factors that are beyond your control and shrouded in secrecy?
