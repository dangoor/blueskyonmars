A British citizen captured in Afghanistan talks about [his hell in Camp X-Ray][1]. This is in stark contrast to the report from a [couple of boys][2] that came earlier in the week. It seems somewhat suspicious that the Britisher, Jamal al-Harith, &#8220;accidentally&#8221; ended up in Afghanistan while he was visiting Pakistan. That aside, this account is quite horrible. If this is accurate, it seems like war crimes charges would be warranted, does it not?
