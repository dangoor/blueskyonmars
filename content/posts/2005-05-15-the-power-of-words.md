Some bloggers regularly reach many thousands of people. There is a lot of power in broad reach combined with credibility, as you can see from a CNN article regarding [a Newsweek screwup][1]. Newsweek, with broad reach and credibility, published an article alleging Quran desecration at Gitmo that created a huge wave of unrest in the Middle East. Fifteen people are dead as a result. That&#8217;s a sobering thought on the power of words.
