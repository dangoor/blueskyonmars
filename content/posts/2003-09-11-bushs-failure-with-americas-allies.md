Fred Kaplan writes [Bush&#8217;s Many Miscalculations &#8211; On Sept. 11, the president was handed a historic opportunity. He ignored it.][1]:

> An American leader could have taken advantage of that moment and reached out to the world, forged new alliances, strengthened old ones, and laid the foundations of a new, broad-based system of international security for the post-Cold War eraâ€”much as Harry Truman and George Marshall had done in the months and years following World War II.
