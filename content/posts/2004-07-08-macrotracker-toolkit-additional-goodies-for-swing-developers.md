While looking around at [Mozdev][1], I found [MacroTracker Project][2]&#8216;s toolkit, which includes a number of Swing components and other classes that provide some useful utility functionality. They start off with the somewhat boring &#8220;MBoldLabel&#8221;, but there are more interesting sounding things farther on down the list.

Curiously, this toolkit is being used to create an [IDE for Mozilla][3] application development. What&#8217;s odd about this, is that there are two IDE frameworks already in Java (NetBeans and Eclipse) and even an IDE written on top of Mozilla (Komodo). But, hey, more power to them if they turn out a nice project!
