If you&#8217;ve ever watched A Baby Story, you&#8217;d know that every pregnancy and deliver is a bit different from every other. Computers are cool, because as long as they&#8217;re functioning properly their behavior is predictable. Organic things are more interesting because the complexity of it all makes them far less predictable. This is my story of our experience with the very organic process of birth.

Our baby&#8217;s due date was July 12th. The pregnancy had gone fine up to that point. We chose to go with certified nurse midwives at the University of Michigan, rather than the traditional OB. Midwives have a reputation for being more flexible about the parent&#8217;s desires for the birth experience. We found all of the midwives we dealt with were great to work with. 

On July 14th, we started post-date monitoring, because the baby&#8217;s size (as measured by size of the uterus) was less than the number of weeks. For the post-date monitoring, they hooked my wife, Surekha, up to an external fetal monitor that took continuous readings of the baby&#8217;s heart rate and any contractions Surekha might have. Surekha had a button to push every time she felt the baby move. That would put a marker on the printout, and the nurses expect to see a correlation between the baby&#8217;s movements and increases in heart rate. 

We&#8217;ve got a very active baby. They usually say that 5-10 movements during an active hour is a sign that the baby is doing fine. Our baby would generally move more like 30 times in an active hour. The fetal monitoring looked great. 

Next comes an ultrasound. When they do these ultrasounds, they are looking to be sure that they can see enough amniotic fluid that is unobstructed by umbilical cord. If there isn&#8217;t enough fluid, there is a chance that they umbilical can be smushed between the baby and the wall of the uterus, cutting off the baby&#8217;s oxygen. 

We passed the first post-date monitoring with flying colors. This was followed by another session on Friday, July 18th, which also went swimmingly. Being a geek, I couldn&#8217;t help but notice that the ultrasound machine on that Friday was one of the fancy new GE machines that can create a 3D image of the baby. Unfortunately, they hadn&#8217;t had their training on it yet, so all we saw was the standard, grainy 2D image. But, everything was fine with the tests, so we were happy. 

For those of you who aren&#8217;t up on the whole pregnancy thing, it&#8217;s the baby that decides when it&#8217;s ready to be born. It sends out a hormone that gets labor going. Our baby kept hitting the snooze, however. On Tuesday, July 22nd, the fetal monitor looked great, but the amniotic fluid index (AFI) had fallen very low. This is another interesting thing about pregnancy: there are a number of tests that have such a high false positive rate that they don&#8217;t call the positive results a &#8220;failure&#8221;, but rather a &#8220;non-reassuring result&#8221;. If the test passes, that&#8217;s reassuring that everything is okay. If it fails, things might still be fine, it&#8217;s just uncertain. 

Given the low AFI, the medical staff (the midwife Stephanie, and one of the OBs) recommended that we induce labor. 

All along, we had the mindset that we wanted a natural childbirth and had studied the Bradley Method(tm) which is almost militantly natural. We weren&#8217;t militant about it, though. We had read enough to know about the myriad of possibilities and were open to what was needed. But, inducing labor was far from our ideal, because we had read that the contractions in induced labor tend to be stronger, increasing the likelihood that some kind of pain medication would be needed. Inducing also meant that Surekha would need to have an IV, which is a lot less comfortable. 

After discussing it with the medical staff, we all agreed that we would go home that day and monitor kicks from the baby periodically to ensure that everything was fine. 5-10 kicks in an active hour is a good sign, and Surekha repeatedly counted 30 in an hour. Our baby was doing fine, but hadn&#8217;t decided to say hello to the world yet. 

We went back to the hospital the next day for another round of monitoring. Fetal activity was still good. Using their spiffy new GE ultrasound, they could more readily identify pockets of fluid that had cord in them. They weren&#8217;t really able to find pockets of fluid that didn&#8217;t have cord, so at that point we agreed to induce labor. We knew this was a possibility, so we had all of our stuff with us and were ready when they admitted us to the hospital at that time. I think it&#8217;s good advice to have your bags with you when you go in for postdate monitoring. 

Once in the room, they hooked Surekha up to an external fetal monitor and started doing paperwork. If you have a patient advocate document, it&#8217;s a good idea to bring that with you. Surekha was on her back for probably 20 minutes doing paperwork, having blood pressure checked, etc. They generally recommend not spending much time on your back, because there is a big artery that provides nutrients to the uterus that can get squeezed by that position. After this time on her back, the baby&#8217;s heart rate dropped from its normal 120s-150s down to the 80s. The staff quickly turned Surekha on to her side and gave her oxygen and the baby&#8217;s heart rate climbed back up. It&#8217;s hard to say if that little scare was caused by lack of fluid or pressing on the artery in the back, but it was still scary. It also meant that for the remainder of labor, there was a risk of the baby&#8217;s heart rate dropping and the need for an emergency c-section. 

At about 7:30PM on Wednesday the 23rd, they started the Petocin drip at a slow 4cc an hour. That night was interrupted by frequent blood pressure checks. We weren&#8217;t getting much sleep, anyhow, because all three of us (Surekha, Surekha&#8217;s mother and me) were keeping a vigilant ear to the baby&#8217;s heart beat coming from the monitor. We knew that the staff outside was monitoring, but it&#8217;s hard not to pay attention when it&#8217;s your baby being monitored. 

After the heart rate scare, they had Surekha lying on her right side. During the pregnancy, she was always many times more comfortable on her left side. After a few hours, a nurse said that she could lie on her left side, after which Surekha was far more comfortable. She still didn&#8217;t sleep much, which we knew would make it a bit harder when the real work of labor began. 

Surekha&#8217;s Petocin-induced contractions were visible on the monitor that she was attached to. You could see them coming regularly, but all through the night they registered as little more than mild cramps to Surekha. Around 9AM, the real work began. 

Surekha handled the pain very well. She followed the deep breathing and concentration techniques taught in the Bradley book we studied. There wasn&#8217;t much for me to do as a coach, because she was doing it all already! I did what I could to help her be comfortable. I helped her walk to the bathroom, because it was difficult for her with the IV attached. Surekha also changed positions a number of times: sometimes she was on the bed, other times on the birthing ball. The bed was good because she could relax fully between contractions. But, the contractions were more intense. On the ball, the contractions were easier to cope with, but she couldn&#8217;t really relax between them. She was able to get a bit of both relaxing and easier contractions from the rocking chair. 

Somewhere between 11AM and noon, there was a fire down the hall. That&#8217;s right, a fire in the hospital while my wife was laboring! There was a strobe in our room that was flashing away, but it turned out that the fire was small and quickly contained. It would have been awful to have to evacuate the hospital at that time!

Just after 3PM, she had reached the end of her rope. She was still handling the pain well, but she was exhausted. Holly, the midwife on duty at that point, checked Surekha&#8217;s cervix and found that it was only 6 cm dilated. At the rate she was moving, it would probably be another 6 hours before she was fully dilated, and then would come the pushing. At that point, we made the decision to go with the epidural. 

The anesthesiologist came in a while later and got things set up. They asked if I was okay with needles, and I told them I would just stay on the front side of Surekha. The epidural is a spot on the spine, and they use a long needle to administer a drug directly to the spine. By 4PM, the drug was flowing via a tiny catheter into Surekha&#8217;s spine and Surekha was feeling much better. 

It was much smoother sailing at that point. Possibly because she was so much more relaxed, by 6:30 Surekha was fully dilated. At 7PM, the next midwife, Stephanie, came on shift. Surekha started pushing around 7:30. 

For some, pushing is very quick. In fact, my sister had one labor that was under two hours in total! For our baby, the pushing involved a lot of back and forth and slow-but-steady progress. As time progressed, I could see more of the baby&#8217;s head. A tuft of hair was one of the first things I could see! 

There was still a ways to go. The baby&#8217;s head would move outward a little and slide back in a little less. Slow progress, but definite progress. Once her head was born, everything else was a quick blur. I could see a hand coming out next to the baby&#8217;s face, and the midwife commented that that would cause some tearing. 

And then, at 9:42PM, Crysania was born! We finally knew we had a girl, and Crysania was placed directly into Surekha&#8217;s arms. We were both just staring at her and soaking in the experience. Somewhere along the way, they asked me to cut the cord (and I did, without fainting! :). The work with the placenta and the stitches continued, but we were completely taken with Crysania. A little later, they did some more suctioning, weighed and measured her, etc. Crysania was awake for hours before she finally fell asleep.

The next day seemed like a constant stream of people (pediatricians, nurses, lactation consultant), all making sure that everything was okay. It was a lot for Crysania to deal with on her first day in the world, but they wanted to take care of it all before we left the hospital. 

Saturday was much calmer and we finally left in the afternoon to go home and start our new lives as parents.
