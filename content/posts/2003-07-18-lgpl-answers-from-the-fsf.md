Though we on JavaBlogs had pretty much figured stuff out, Slashdot provoked [answers from the FSF][1]. David Turner himself [responded][2] and had a nice summary of what Section 6 of the LGPL really means:

> 1. Make sure your licensing follows the simple requirements in the 1st para of section 6.
> 
> 2. Provide the LGPL library in a separate jar, and allow that jar to be replaced by newer versions of the library. This is only one of the possible ways to comply, but it&#8217;s certainly the easiest.
> 
> 3. Make available the source code for the LGPL library. 

The 1st requirement above is that your license does not deny the customer the ability to reverse engineer for their own use.
