For some reason, I had expected Tim Bray to be more strongly in the pro-RDF/semantic web camp. It turns out that he sees things similarly to the way I do: [Metadata, Semantics and All That][1]. He talks about wanting a critical mass of &#8220;metadata&#8221;, but his example of company information seems to me to be actual &#8220;data&#8221;. He talks about XBRL for reporting business information, which I think makes my point [from Saturday][2]. Using well-defined and accepted XML formats provides a great deal of value for data interchange, because you have all of the context you need.
