I swear I&#8217;m not linking to this article because Ian mentioned me. Ian Landsman, who is in the process of starting up UserScape, wrote a great article for anyone considering starting a software business: [Starting a Micro ISV, In The Beginningâ€¦.. there was nothing][1]. Ian has been following many of the same sorts of people that I have, and the advice he gives is much of the same sort of advice that I would give, only he has written it up in a much better article than the ones I&#8217;ve posted so far.

So, if you&#8217;re even halfway thinking about starting a software business, read this article right now. And do go to Amazon and buy [Purple Cow][2] (and [Free Prize Inside!][3]). While you&#8217;re at it, you should sign up for [Seth Godin&#8217;s blog][4], because he generously provides useful marketing tips _every day_. You&#8217;ll note that Ian didn&#8217;t write about the technology choices you&#8217;ll have to make. That stuff will work itself out&#8230; it&#8217;s the product positioning, marketing and fit-and-finish kinds of things that will really take the effort.
