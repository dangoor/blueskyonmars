This is a question that many people ask webloggers (and that many webloggers probably ask themselves). It often seems that we write for some nameless, faceless audience. That, of course, is not entirely true&#8230; many of the people that read our blogs have blogs of their own. We can communicate with them through our blogs and many have independent conversations in email. So, in many cases, the audience is not nameless&#8230; we know who they are.

In my case, I know who my audience is: me. As far as I know, no one reads this site. It&#8217;s an unusual feeling to publish something in a format that makes it available to everyone, and yet have the knowledge that there is no one reading. But, that&#8217;s not a problem for me. I just like the fact that I can come back to this site whenever I want and check out what I was thinking about in the past.

[Note: I wrote the paragraph above on the bus this morning. At the time that I wrote it, I had every reason to believe that no one reads this site. Suddenly, I noticed that there was a comment to a blog post on April 16th. Wow. At least on that day, there was someone out there&#8230;]
