I only watched snippets of the AMAs. There weren&#8217;t any runaway winners. Alicia Keys, Destiny&#8217;s Child, Aaliyah and Tim McGraw each won two awards. The AMAs are voted on by a survey of 20,000 record buyers, so it&#8217;s not surprising that they match up well with sales. The Grammys, which are picked by industry people, can vary considerably from sales (take Steely Dan&#8217;s win last year, for example). The Grammys are Feb 27.
