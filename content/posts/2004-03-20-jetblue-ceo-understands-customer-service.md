Here&#8217;s an inspiring (in a businessy sort of way) tale of [JetBlue&#8217;s CEO doing steward duty on one of their flights][1]. This CEO, Dave Neeleman really puts the customer first, relying on first hand knowledge of customer wants instead of statistics in customer surveys and the like. His tactics are also great for motivating employees, who see their CEO taking all sorts of jobs seriously.
