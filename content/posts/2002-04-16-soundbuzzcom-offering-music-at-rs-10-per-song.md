An Indian company is offering music for download at [Rs. 10 per song][1], which is about 20 cents. Something to understand is that 20 cents is more to them than it is to us. However, if the major labels were to offer ddownloads for $1 a song, you&#8217;d probably still get a lot of takers. That is assuming (probably wrongly) that they are offering the music in listener friendly formats.
