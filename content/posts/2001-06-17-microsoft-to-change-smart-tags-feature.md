[Yahoo! Groups : decentralization][1]: _&#8220;Because of the &#8212; and there&#8217;s no better word for it, we&#8217;re shocked &#8212;
  
uproar, the following changes are going to be made:
  
1. smart tags off by default (they were on by default to exercise the code,
  
get Watson crashes)
  
2. the user-overrides-authored-meta-tag option removed
  
3. no recognizers shipping in box. So until you do have a recognizer
  
<!--more-->


  
installed, when you click on the smart tag button, you get navigated to a
  
gallery from which you can download desired recognizers.&#8221;_ To me, this reads like good news. The smart tags feature, implemented as above, gives everyone involved flexibility (including site owners), and that&#8217;s a good thing.
