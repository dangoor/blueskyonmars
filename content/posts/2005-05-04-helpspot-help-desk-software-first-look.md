Ian is starting on the path toward beta of [HelpSpot][1] and has given a [first look][2] at HelpSpot&#8217;s request view. Many help desk systems are way too complicated for many people who just need to effectively track customer requests. This looks like a good balance and a good way to make sure things don&#8217;t get dropped.
