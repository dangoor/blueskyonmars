I&#8217;ve been curious about reading Wolfram&#8217;s A New Kind Of Science for a while, but not quite curious enough to shell out the dough yet. Now I don&#8217;t have to&#8230; They&#8217;ve put the [entire book online][1] for reading. If I start reading it and like what I see, I&#8217;ll likely buy the book&#8230; but this is a good way to check it out.

Which reminds me&#8230; I&#8217;ve really come to the conclusion that the 30 second song samples that are commonplace in online music stores suck. 30 seconds is just not enough time to tell if a track will be enjoyable to me. They could make a 30 second high quality sample and a full-length, low quality sample and that would let me get a better feel for the song.
