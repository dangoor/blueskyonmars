[Lessig Proposes &#8220;Creative Commons&#8221;][1] &#8211; _n/a_ [[Slashdot][2]] Lawrence Lessig has been talking about this for a while, and now he&#8217;s actually creating (in conjunction with some other universities) licenses to match. His intention is to have licenses that allow things to easily move into the public domain when they are no longer earning money for their creators. Given that current copyright terms are so long, this is a good thing.
