Mike Bayer and others have been involved in a pretty significant rejiggering (that&#8217;s the technical term) of SQLAlchemy. Much of the common user API is unchanged, but some of the pieces have become considerably more flexible. Additionally, Mike has rolled out a new site: [SQLAlchemy &#8211; The Database Toolkit for Python][1]

> SQLAlchemy has a strong community, which provides patches and updates on a regular basis. Included with SQLAlchemy are several user-supplied extensions, including ActiveMapper, SqlSoup and SelectResults. SQLAlchemy is involved in a high-profile integration with TurboGears, is growing in popularity within the Zope community, and is under evaluation to be the underlying database API used by Trac.

So, in answer to [Eliza&#8217;s question][2], according to the SQLAlchemy web page, TurboGears is indeed looking at SQLAlchemy ðŸ™‚

Beyond just looking at it, TurboGears already features SQLAlchemy integration (and work is underway to ensure that TurboGears works properly with the latest releases ofÃ‚Â  SQLAlchemy).
