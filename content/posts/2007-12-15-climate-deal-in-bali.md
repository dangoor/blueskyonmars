More often than not, politics can be annoying&#8230; So, [a bunch of people finished a big meeting in Bali][1] about climate change and how to deal with it. How did they do?

> &#8220;This is a real breakthrough, a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change,&#8221; said Indonesian Environment Minister Rachmat Witoelar, who served as conference president, at the conclusion of the talks.

Gee, that sounds swell. I have a feeling that Witoelar was prepared to say that even if a big turd had dropped from the sky and landed just outside of the conference hall. The way this breakthrough was achieved was:

> The EU and US agreed to drop binding targets; then the EU and China agreed to soften language on commitments from developing countries.

Err, so they reached a deal without binding targets and with soft language about commitments. What kind of deal is that? Certainly not a breakthrough. The real statement to go with a meeting like this is:

&#8220;We have effectively managed to hold off any real decision making for two more years.&#8221;
