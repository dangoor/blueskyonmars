Yes, the iPhone is cool. Way cool, even. Apple TV looks like a nice product as well. But, this is &#8220;Mac&#8221; World Expo, right?

I&#8217;m a Mac user and I was more interested in the things that weren&#8217;t announced today: a new 12&#8243; MacBook Pro, iLife &#8217;07 and iWork &#8217;07. We all know they&#8217;re coming&#8230; My guess is that iLife and iWork have been put on hold to coincide with the release of Leopard, and will possibly require Leopard. Oh well, I&#8217;ll just have to wait on the software updates.

The interesting thing about today&#8217;s keynote is that you can&#8217;t have either of the products that Jobs was talking about right now. They&#8217;re taking orders for Apple TV, which ships in February&#8230; that&#8217;s not too far off. But the iPhone isn&#8217;t coming until June. This is not the kind of announcements that Jobs has been known for.

Interestingly, though, I think there&#8217;s a good reason to have announced the iPhone now. It&#8217;s been rumored for months now, and it would likely have been impossible to keep details from leaking between now and the release date. The iPhone would have made far less of a splash if the details we saw today were known in advance.

I&#8217;ll just have to keep an eye on the _next_ Steve Jobs presentation, which will likely be the one that I&#8217;m waiting for.
