Some enterprising (read: &#8220;crazy&#8221;) folks have gone and [implemented CSS3 multicolumn support][1] \*in JavaScript\*. Very nifty. As I noted a few days ago, though, multiple columns [is not so great for reading on-screen][2]. A printed view that uses multiple columns would be beautiful, however, and it&#8217;s quite cool that people using browsers other than Firefox 1.1 can get in on the action.
