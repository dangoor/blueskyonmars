This past Tuesday, I had the pleasure of attending Seth Godin&#8217;s [The Dip][1] <img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blueskyonmars-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1591841666" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />talk at the Michigan Theater. Here&#8217;s a photo from Seth&#8217;s blog:

It&#8217;s been a busy week, so I haven&#8217;t had a chance to write about this until now.

The first thing I want to say is this: if you&#8217;re still doing presentations with bullet points, you _need_ to see someone like Seth Godin speak. It will give you a whole new appreciation for how best to present material. Bullet points ain&#8217;t it. If you&#8217;ve ever seen me present, you&#8217;ve probably noticed that I don&#8217;t use bullet points. I&#8217;m definitely still honing my technique, but Seth has achieved master level. If you can&#8217;t catch Seth live, I&#8217;d recommend checking out [An Inconvenient Truth][2]<img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blueskyonmars-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B000ICL3KG" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />. Al Gore&#8217;s presentation in that movie is bigger budget and less readily attainable than Seth&#8217;s technique, but it will still give you an idea of what to shoot for.

I&#8217;d imagine that Seth would consider himself a failure if I just wrote about his presentation style and not the content he was presenting. After all, it&#8217;s not a very effective presentation if the flash gets ahead of the substance. I read The Dip before seeing the talk, and the talk was a nice companion to the book. The Dip is a small book (under 100 pages), which I appreciate. Many business books have an idea that can be readily condensed into a 5 page summary, but they carry on for 200, 300 or more pages just repeating the same idea over and over in slightly different styles with or without actual supporting evidence. I often get the feeling from business books that they&#8217;re trying to perform &#8220;proof by repeated assertion&#8221;. At 100 pages, The Dip felt about right in terms of size. The one thing that I felt was missing was personal anecdotes. It&#8217;s the perfect kind of book for stories about how Seth himself has tackled &#8220;The Dip&#8221;, but instead we get stories about how well-known others have successfully tackled The Dip.

So, what is &#8220;The Dip&#8221;? Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll get there. This is one of the other interesting aspects to Seth Godin in general: he likes for his ideas and terminology to spread. Whether it&#8217;s a purple cow or an ideavirus, Seth wants people to learn and use these terms. To that end, everyone who attended The Dip (live!) received 5 copies of The Dip (book), to pass around. Each copy of the book includes a page in the back where you can put a list of names to try to get a group of people to pass it around. I have no idea if that technique works, but the 5 copies per person idea certainly does. People will inevitably think of friends and colleagues who might benefit from The Dip and pass it on. Thus, Seth&#8217;s ideas and terminology claim some more vic&#8212;-, I mean supporters. If you Google &#8220;The Dip&#8221; or just &#8220;dip&#8221;, Seth has the #2 link. The idea has spread.

At last we get to the point where _I_ contribute to the spread of the idea. &#8220;The Dip&#8221; is the point in an endeavor where the going gets rough. Seth makes the point that quitting in The Dip is what most people do, and it&#8217;s exactly the wrong thing to do. You should anticipate the Dip. If you&#8217;re not going to put forth the effort to get through it, you shouldn&#8217;t even start the undertaking. But once you make it through the Dip, you&#8217;ll be among the best in the world. And that is what the book &#8220;The Dip&#8221; is truly about: quitting the things that you aren&#8217;t going to master and becoming the best in the world at the thing that matters most.

For me, personally, The Dip&#8217;s message about quitting excess things is timely and relevant. I&#8217;ve had so many things going on and so many things vying for my time outside of work, that maintaining focus is important. Some post-The Dip reflection has identified a couple of things that I&#8217;ve been able to quit. And it feels good.

While [Purple Cow][3] <img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=blueskyonmars-20&l=as2&o=1&a=159184021X" style="border: medium none  ! important; margin: 0px ! important" border="0" height="1" width="1" />remains my favorite among the Godin books that I have read, The Dip is a potentially more broadly useful quick read for stories and thoughts about being the very best. Your investment in time in reading the book will be well worth it. I&#8217;d also highly recommend seeing the live show if Seth will be coming to you. (And a big &#8220;thanks!&#8221; to the folks who organized the Ann Arbor event!)
