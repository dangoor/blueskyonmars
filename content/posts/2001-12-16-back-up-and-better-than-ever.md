I just installed a snapshot of the current drupal cvs and added my patches to it. It&#8217;s looking good. Now I can hopefully get my patches installed in drupal so that I don&#8217;t need to do that again :).

It looks like there&#8217;s lots of new stuff going on in this version of drupal, and I&#8217;ll finally be back online with Weblogs.com.
