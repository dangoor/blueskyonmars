Mozilla has been an extraordinary place to work over the nearly 4 years that I have been with the organization. Many times that I&#8217;ve been out and about wearing [a Firefox shirt][1], random strangers would talk to me about Firefox. Some of those times, it has proven to be a great opportunity to tell people about how Mozilla is a non-profit organization that&#8217;s out to [make the web better for everyone][2].

A lot of people seem surprised that there&#8217;s a software company with widely used software that is truly built for the public good, but it&#8217;s absolutely true. As a product manager, I&#8217;ve been involved in many discussions where we talk about what Mozilla should build next and we are _always_ working on behalf of users. It can be refreshing to not have to think about &#8220;where does the money come from?&#8221; for once. Of course, cultivating a very user-centric view of the world is a positive thing in general, even in for-profit enterprises.

How great is it to work with a large community of people, all focused on helping everyone experience a better web and building some awesome open source software? It&#8217;s truly amazing.

Over the past few months, I&#8217;ve been thinking that I wanted to get back into software development. There&#8217;s something magical about the hands-on building of software, and I think that the right thing for me at this time is to get back to it. I considered a number of interesting options to get back to building software within Mozilla.

Ultimately, though, I just couldn&#8217;t pass up the chance to work on Adobe&#8217;s open source [Brackets][3] project. You may remember that I worked on a browser-based code editor when I started at Mozilla (Bespin, later renamed to Skywriter and ultimately merged with [Ace][4]). Brackets is a fairly new project, but it&#8217;s already surfacing interesting ideas and has a great [dogfooding][5] experience. The development team is really sharp and the community is active and wonderful and I think we&#8217;re going to have a good time together building an awesome code editor for web projects. It&#8217;s already quite usable, so give it a spin!

Adobe, in general, has tons of work going on [&#8220;to help move the web forward&#8221;][6] and their long history of awesome tools for creative people can help feed a lot of new ideas to the web.

I&#8217;ll be starting work on Brackets on Monday.

A big thank you to all of my friends and colleagues at Mozilla for four fabulous years. I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to recommend [working there][7]&#8230; there&#8217;s a ton of work to do in [desktop browsing][8] still, [mobile browsing][9] is also hot, oh and there&#8217;s that little bit [about cracking open the whole mobile ecosystem][10]&#8230; not to mention plenty of [new possibilities in developer tools][11]!
