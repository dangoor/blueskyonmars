Yesterday, I worked from home because Crysania was suffering from fluid in her middle ear. Having two parents around at such times definitely seems a big help. Crysania just turned one last Saturday, and this is her second &#8220;ear thing&#8221;. The first was after we got back from Hawaii in December and was likely caused by the plane travel. These things are very uncomfortable, and I&#8217;m thankful that she&#8217;s only had two. Some kids in day care have these kinds of problems regularly. Crysania&#8217;s doctor even asked if she was in a group care setting.

Today, I&#8217;m home sick. Crysania doesn&#8217;t have any cold symptoms, so I don&#8217;t know where my bug came from. No coding today, I&#8217;ll give my brain a rest to try and recover. We were supposed to be in Kentucky now, but we cancelled because of Crysania&#8217;s ear pain&#8230; the previous few days had not been very restful because of getting ready for the trip.
