CNET reports that [the 4 campus file swappers are to pay the RIAA][1] $12,000-$17,000 each over the next few years. That&#8217;s quite a big drop from the $100 billion or whatever huge number it was that the RIAA was originally suing for. I&#8217;m sure that the point of this is not the money, which is piddly for this organization, but the point that the RIAA is willing to crush any of their &#8220;customers&#8221; who might be considering &#8220;sharing&#8221; their &#8220;music&#8221;.
