Dave Winer has caused a [stir][1] with his first [Scripting News Awards][2]. Cam sees them as a big ego stroke for Dave, and doesn&#8217;t particularly care for the fact that he&#8217;s been nominated. My opinion: sure, Dave&#8217;s got an ego. But, the awards page says &#8220;These are my favorite weblogs.&#8221; Dave&#8217;s got a lot of readers and wanted to recognize the blogs that are most important to him.

I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with that. It&#8217;s like saying &#8220;These are my 10 favorite movies, what do you think of them?&#8221; (And if Cam doesn&#8217;t want to be a part of it, he can just ignore it.)
