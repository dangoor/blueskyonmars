Actually, this is a defense not only of LAMP, but of people out in the trenches doing Java with Spring and Hibernate as well. [IBM poop heads say LAMP users need to &#8220;grow up&#8221;][1]

Ryan is right on target with this piece. Keeping things simple and evolving as needs dictate is a great way to get an app built and to make it scale to anywhere it needs to go.

The next time someone says that they need their .NET frontend talking to a J2EE three-tier backend over SOAP, you&#8217;re probably in a position to save them a lot of money.
