Over the past day, I&#8217;ve had hundreds of spam comments and trackbacks sent to my site. About 1/4 of these made it through to the site, but I&#8217;ve been pretty quick to delete them using WordPress&#8217; &#8220;Mass Edit Mode&#8221;. Still, it&#8217;s annoying to have to do that at all.

This morning I installed [JSSpamBlock][1], which uses a clever technique to make it so that normal web-browsing humans don&#8217;t need to do anything different to post a comment. If you have JavaScript turned off, you have to enter a number.

I may have to turn off trackbacks, at least temporarily, depending on the level of spam traffic that makes it through that way.
