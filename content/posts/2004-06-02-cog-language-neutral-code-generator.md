Here&#8217;s a [Python Success Story][1] describing [Cog][2], an easy-to-use code generation system. It&#8217;s written in Python, but it can mark up files in any language (the author&#8217;s project apparently has 4 different languages in use). This looks nicely done and useful for a variety of applications.
