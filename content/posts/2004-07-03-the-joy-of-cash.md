Here&#8217;s a good Motley Fool commentary by Whitney Tilson that shares how I feel about the current state of investing: [Fool.com: The Joy of Cash][1]. One interesting thing to get from this: mutual funds are not _always_ the best place to have your money. A Vanguard index fund is good because it&#8217;s cheap, but if the stock market goes sideways for the next few years, you&#8217;ll basically get no return.

Recognizing that high stock prices, rising interest rates and other factors mean that there aren&#8217;t many good investment choices, cash is not a bad place to have a chunk of your portfolio right now. Tilson says that he&#8217;s got 35% in cash. Berkshire Hathaway has $70 billion in cash and bonds. Do you want to second guess Warren Buffett?
