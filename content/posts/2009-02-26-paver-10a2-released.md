I&#8217;m happy to announce that Paver 1.0a2 has been released! And, unlike Paver 1.0a1, it installs (thanks to [Greg Thornton][1] for the patch for that!). I&#8217;ve been quite busy with other projects over the past month, so I appreciate the help of Marc Sibson and Greg Thornton in making 1.0a2 a nice improvement over 1.0a1.

Paver 1.0 is still for the slightly adventurous, because it has not yet seen testing by many people. Paver is not complex code (and Paver 1.0 is, I think, less complex than Paver 0.8 was), so it&#8217;s not hard to dig in if you have a problem.

Assuming nothing major comes up, I expect Paver 1.0 final to be out by PyCon.

Speaking of PyCon, I won&#8217;t be attending PyCon this year as I have a lot of other things on my plate at work this time around. [Mark Ramm][2] will be doing the Paver talk in my stead, just as he did at PyOhio last year.
