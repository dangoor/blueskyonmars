This past weekend, Best Buy offered free electronic waste recycling. The amount of junk people brought out was amazing:

Seeing all of that stuff there and knowing that this is just the Ann Arbor Best Buy really brings it home about just how much of this stuff we all collect and trash. The good thing, though, is that it all ended up here. It will be recycle or at least disposed of properly so that the mercury, lead, etc. don&#8217;t wind up in the ground.
