[Unisys Apologizes for Creating Unintended Consequences of the Computer Age][1]: _&#8220;Unisys Corporation today issued a public apology for the many human inconveniences resulting from its invention of UNIVAC I, the world&#8217;s first commercial computer, introduced on June 14, 1951.&#8221;_ This press release, which mentions things like not being able to do more than 5 minutes of work before being interrupted by an emailed joke, is an amusing way for Unisys to highlight the fact that 50 years ago they fired up the UNIVAC I.
