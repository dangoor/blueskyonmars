For those that have been following my blog, the lack of activity over the past few days has probably seemed a little unusual. I had mentioned earlier in the year that we&#8217;re having a baby (and added the &#8220;Parenting&#8221; category, which seems slightly out of place with all of the geeking out that happens here).

On July 24th, our baby girl was born! Her name is Crysania and she&#8217;s really cute. I&#8217;ll post a picture later, and I&#8217;m sure there will be more pictures coming. At some point, I&#8217;ll write about the birth itself. Quite an experience, and these last few days have been an interesting introduction to parenting. I&#8217;m glad that I&#8217;m taking two weeks off of work.
