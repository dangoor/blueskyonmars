I&#8217;ve been a longtime fan of [Rotten Tomatoes][1], and I still am! I find that the Tomatometer is a pretty good indicator of whether a movie is decent or a stinker. Sure, there are times when I&#8217;ll disagree with the critics&#8230; but more often than not, I&#8217;ll agree with the consensus of the critics, if not the opinions of a single critic. I went looking for a site that would do the same for music, and I found [metacritic: Film Reviews, Game Reviews, Music Reviews, DVD Reviews][2]. Yep, everything all in one place. Pretty spiffy looking. Now to start figuring out if I agree with the opinions that appear there. 

Music is a particularly dicey thing when it comes to reviews, because everyone has their own tastes. Right now, I&#8217;m really enjoying listening to &#8220;My Band&#8221; by D12, &#8220;Going Under&#8221; by Evanescence (man, pop radio really missed the boat on that one!) and &#8220;Yeah&#8221; by Usher. &#8220;Yeah&#8221; is amazing because of how simple the music is. The interplay of the elements in that song make for a phenomenal piece of pop music (12 weeks at #1 says that I&#8217;m not the only person who thinks is phenomenal pop&#8230;)
