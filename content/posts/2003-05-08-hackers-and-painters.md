The always enjoyable Paul Graham has a new article entitled [&#8220;Hackers and Painters&#8221;][1]. He talks about &#8220;computer science&#8221; and &#8220;software engineering&#8221; as being misrepresentations of what hackers do. He draws the parallel, not surprisingly, to painters and other &#8220;makers&#8221;. It&#8217;s an interesting parallel. He&#8217;s downbeat on the notion of pair programming for certain:

> When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room. It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft.

I don&#8217;t quite agree with this, because I think that the XP methodology has a process that works around this notion. However, I don&#8217;t think XP is for everyone, and it&#8217;s probably not for Paul Graham.
  
Software is an interesting beast, because creating it is both a creative process and a kind of engineering. Computers require very precise instructions&#8230; precision that is not as important (or necessarily even desirable!) in paintings, writing and music.
