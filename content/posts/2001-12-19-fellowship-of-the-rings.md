Well, the big movie is out&#8230; You&#8217;ve probably read the other reviews (which are all way up there). Now you can read mine.

We went to the Showcase Cinemas for the 9:30 showing. There was no line at the ticket kiosk, so I went up there. It told me that the show was locked by management. So, we went to the ticket counter. The line was pretty short there. The fact that the lines were short but the parking lot was full should&#8217;ve told me something&#8230; both the 9:30 and 10:15 shows were sold out. Showcase had the movie on 5 screens.

So, we drove across town to the Quality 16 to try to catch the 9:55 show. We got there about 9:30. There was a long line, but the electronic sign said that Fellowship of the Rings was sold out.

My review is this: &#8220;Fellowship of the Rings is not so much a movie, as an experience. The experience is not unlike driving around, parking, walking in 30 degree, windy weather and then being turned away. The visuals, sound and plot have not quite lived up to the hype for me.&#8221;

That said, I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be long before I get in to see it, and I&#8217;m looking forward to it.
