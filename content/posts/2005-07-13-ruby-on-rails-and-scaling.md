David Heinemeier Hansson has written a rebuttal to the &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t scale&#8221; argument [in defense of Ruby on Rails][1]. It&#8217;s a good, concise article that applies equally well to all of the variants of LAMP. If someone is giving you grief about scaling something in Python/Ruby/PHP/Perl or Java without EJB, David&#8217;s article and [Ryan Tomayko&#8217;s earlier article][2] provide good counters so you don&#8217;t have to write your own.
