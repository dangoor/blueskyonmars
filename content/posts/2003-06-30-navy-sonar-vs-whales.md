Environmental groups and the Navy are going head-to-head [Wired in court about the Navy&#8217;s new ultra-loud Sonar system][1].

> By authorizing the Navy to test LFA in as much as 75 percent of the world&#8217;s oceans, the Bush administration may have violated a number of environmental regulations, including provisions of the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

Does anything more really need to be said about this administration and the environment?
