Three months (almost to the day) after she stood independently for the first time, Crysania started walking without support yesterday! She seemed thrilled about it, and so were we!

For anyone else out there with an &#8220;early talker, late walker&#8221;, don&#8217;t give up hope! As long as your child makes forward progress small bits at a time, it&#8217;ll all work out. It&#8217;s actually a blessing to have a child that can communicate well verbally and isn&#8217;t running around getting into everything.
