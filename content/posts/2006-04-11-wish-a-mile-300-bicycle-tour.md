A friend of mine (hi, Dave!) is riding in the [Wish-A-Mile 300 Bicycle Tour][1] for the Make-A-Wish Foundation which tries to grant wishes to children with life-threatening disesases. The &#8220;300&#8221; is the number of miles he&#8217;s got to ride in _three days_. In years past, Dave and I have done bike tours together, but those tours maxed out at about 65 miles in a day. 100 miles three days in a row is a lot. If you&#8217;d like to help Dave reach his lofty $4.000 goal for the children, you can follow the link at the beginning of the paragraph to make a donation.
