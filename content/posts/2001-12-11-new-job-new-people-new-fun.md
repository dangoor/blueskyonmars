Today was my second day at [CareerSite][1]. As usual, when starting in a new place there are a lot of new faces and names to remember. I&#8217;ve never been very good at that, but I&#8217;ve been doing mostly okay. CareerSite is still a small company (30 or so people) and has a lot of the fun and challenging aspects you find in a company that size. The potential is fabulous.

I think we&#8217;ll really do some great things and have a good time while we&#8217;re doing it. Can&#8217;t ask for much more in a job ðŸ™‚
