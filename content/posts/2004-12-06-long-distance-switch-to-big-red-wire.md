I&#8217;ve just switched our long distance service to [bigredwire][1]. 2.7 cents per minute, no fees (though there are some taxes added to that). I&#8217;ve been meaning to switch ever since Sprint started charging a monthly fee. It&#8217;s crazy to pay Sprint $5 per month, given that I don&#8217;t even use their service! We&#8217;ve been using [One Suite][2], which is a pre-paid service that offers super low rates (2.4 cents in the US, 9 cents per minute to Bangalore, India!). Unfortunately, One Suite&#8217;s call quality has been dropping drastically. I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re using VOIP on the back end and not at a good quality level.

bigredwire, by the way, offers 20 cents per minute calls to Bangalore, and free member-to-member calling.

brw is also interesting because they hae these little hexagon faces that they use to represent everything. I got email from &#8220;jack&#8221;, their customer service face. Kinda weird, but mildly pleasant as well.
