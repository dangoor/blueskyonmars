Roxio, makers of one of the most popular CD burning programs, _and_ owners of the Napster name announced a plan to [buy Pressplay][1] from the two major labels that founded it. Roxio is spending $39.5 million on Pressplay. Add that to the $5 million they spent on Napster, and the $20 million they plan to spend, and they&#8217;ve got themselves a $65 million gamble. If they can do anywhere near the business Apple is doing, it may not be such a bad gamble&#8230; but that&#8217;s a big if.
