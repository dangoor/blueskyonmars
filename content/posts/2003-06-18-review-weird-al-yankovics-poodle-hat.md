Hard to say whether this is a music review or a comedy review&#8230; either way, it&#8217;s a review of &#8220;Weird Al&#8221; Yankovic&#8217;s latest, Poodle Hat. Poodle Hat, Al&#8217;s first album in 4 years, follows the exact same formula as his &#8217;90s albums: mix in about 45% parodies, 45% originals, and a polka medley of songs for good measure. If you didn&#8217;t like this formula in the past, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll start liking it now. This review also covers the latest AL-TV.

Al is in fine form on Poodle Hat. The lead single, &#8220;Couch Potato&#8221;, is a solid parody of Eminem&#8217;s huge hit &#8220;Lose Yourself&#8221;. The lyrics are great, picking on all sorts of pop culture bits of the day with mentions of [Simon Cowell][1] and [Tivo][2]. I&#8217;m not as fond of &#8220;Trash Day&#8221;, the parody of Nelly&#8217;s ubiquitous &#8220;Hot In Herre&#8221;. It just didn&#8217;t quite grab me in the same way as the others. That&#8217;s even more the case for &#8220;Piano Man&#8221;. On previous albums, with &#8220;Jurassic Park&#8221; and &#8220;The Saga Begins&#8221;, Al chose to pick on some older songs, and I&#8217;m just not as keen on those parodies. Your mileage may vary.

Despite not liking his parodies of older songs, I do really like &#8220;Bob&#8221;, Al&#8217;s take on Bob Dylan. The singing style and the nonsensical, palindromic lyrics are just plain fun to listen to. I also enjoyed the &#8220;Hardware Store&#8221; original tune.

&#8220;eBay&#8221; is a great parody of the Backstreet Boys&#8217; &#8220;I Want It That Way&#8221;. Al mentions all sorts of things that you could really imagine being available right now on eBay, with the possible exception of &#8220;a kleenex used by Dr. Dre&#8221;.

&#8220;A Complicated Song&#8221; is, not surprisingly, a parody of Avril Levigne&#8217;s &#8220;Complicated&#8221;. It&#8217;s funny, but I&#8217;d put it in the middle of the pack on this album.

Poodle Hat is a good addition to the &#8220;Weird Al&#8221; library. If you don&#8217;t like what Al does, this album will probably not change your feelings. But, with 50,000 sold in the first week (Al&#8217;s biggest first week sales), it&#8217;s obvious that Al still has fans out there. I think most fans will enjoy this album.

The latest AL-TV can be seen on VH-1 now:

> June 17 11:00 AM
  
> June 17 11:00 PM (official premiere)
  
> June 18 3:30 PM
  
> June 19 12:00 AM
  
> June 23 10:00 PM
  
> June 24 4:00 PM
  
> June 26 1:00 AM

The latest AL-TV features interviews with Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, Celine Dion and Eminem. Al&#8217;s interviews basically consist of Al asking questions and pulling quotes out of context from a real interview. Some of these interviews were really funny. The rest of the show was basically a commercial for _Poodle Hat_. It starts off with a video for &#8220;Bob&#8221; (done in the style of INXS&#8217; &#8220;Mediate&#8221;) and has Al&#8217;s parodies played over top of the real videos for several songs. Eminem didn&#8217;t want Al to do a video for &#8220;Couch Potato&#8221;, so there is no lead video for _Poodle Hat_. The show ends with the excellent &#8220;All About The Pentiums&#8221; video.

If you enjoy fake interviews, you&#8217;ll probably enjoy AL-TV. I did.
