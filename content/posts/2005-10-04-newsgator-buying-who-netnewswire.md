There&#8217;s a rumor that Newsgator [is going to buy NetNewsWire][1]. I completely believe this rumor, and I&#8217;d imagine that this has been in the works for a while. When Newsgator bought FeedDemon (and Nick Bradbury), it seemed like NetNewsWire would be an obvious choice for them to build out Mac support.

Since I fully believe this rumor, I&#8217;ll just say congrats to [Brent Simmons][2] now.
