There are lots of interesting tools out there for capturing screen displays along with audio for demo purposes. [Camtasia Studio &#8211; Screen Recording for Demos and Training][1] looks like a good one for the PC. It allows you to easily add callouts and other features like that. It&#8217;s $299, but it&#8217;s really tuned for making demos and training materials.

There are some nice low-end options on the Mac. On the way low end, there&#8217;s [Screen Record][2] for only $20. It will record the screen with audio and save it as a Quicktime movie. That may seem pretty raw, but you combine that with iMovie for editing and Keynote for pulling together the demo, and it&#8217;s not such a bad thing.

[Snapz Pro X][3] is generally regarded as the creme de la creme of screen capture utilities for the Mac. Lots of options, and lots of polish on the UI. It&#8217;s $69.

Update 2/20/05: The current version of [Wink][4] doesn&#8217;t do audio or video capture, but it does let you capture screen shots and add annotations to make nice, compact Flash movies.

By the way, [Joel][5] had a good experience with Camtasia.

Update 8/17/05: I just learned about [CamStudio][6], which is free, does audio and video, does captions, produces AVIs and SWFs and runs on Windows. Oh, and did I mention it&#8217;s _free_!
