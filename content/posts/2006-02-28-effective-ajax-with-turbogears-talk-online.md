My PyCon talk, [Effective Ajax with TurboGears][1], is now available online. The visuals for the presentation were done in TurboGears (bah! who needs PowerPoint!). The tarball for that project, plus a screencast of the presentation (recorded before PyCon) and a written version of the talk all appear on the 0.9 preview site.
