The second day of solids was more successful than the first. I think it&#8217;s partly that Crysania had napped better today and was in a better mood overall. We used a spoon today, and she was definitely interested in it and I think she ingested at least a little of the food. She didn&#8217;t seem to be rejecting the food, but it also appeared that she didn&#8217;t know that she&#8217;s supposed to go ahead and swallow it. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll get the hang of it before we know it.

Also, I wanted to keep a link to [Safe and Secure Baby.com][1] which looks like a pretty comprehensive site of baby safety products. They even have items that will prevent a child from opening the lever-style door handles that we have here. Cool!
