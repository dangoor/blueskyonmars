The main [TurboGears mailing list][1] has just passed 1,500 members. Even with the 0.9 release in an underdocumented alpha state, we&#8217;ve still got new people showing up every day. The list broke 1,000 back in January.

Another interesting milestone on the mailing list: it looks like Jorge Godoy is going to beat me out for top poster this month! And Jorge and I are both running well behind Michele Cella for top poster on the TurboGears Trunk mailing list. It&#8217;s definitely a sign of a thriving community to see the lists humming along like this.
