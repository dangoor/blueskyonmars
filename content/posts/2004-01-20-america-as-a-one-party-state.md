Robert Kuttner wrote [&#8220;America as a One-Party State&#8221;][1], which describes how the current Republican party roster has been making dramatic process changes that essentially shut out the Democrats and make it difficult for the Democrats to regain control. If the Democrats win the White House this year, that will certainly make things more difficult in this particular Republican agenda.
