[musicplasma : the music visual search engine][1] is exactly what it sounds like. It visually helps you find artists you might like. You enter an artist and it creates a maps that shows connections between artists in terms of artists that people tend to like. Search for &#8220;Nirvana&#8221;, and it&#8217;s not surprising that many Nirvana fans like the Foo Fighters. There are a number of other bands that match for Nirvana that might not be quite as obvious.
