Much as it seemed that online radio had been killed by the huge license fees that were set up, I guess the final nail has not been put in that coffin. Apparently, [AOL and XM have joined forces][1] to create a new online radio site offering 150 channels to _anyone_ for free (including 20 XM channels). $5/month gets you 70 more XM channels. Cool! Something new to listen to when I&#8217;m working.
