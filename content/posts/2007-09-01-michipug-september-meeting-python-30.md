As Guido announced on his blog yesterday: [Python 3000 alpha 1 has been released!][1]

On that note, I&#8217;ll lead an informal run through of what&#8217;s new in Python 3.0 at the next Michigan Python Users Group (MichiPUG) meeting.

The meeting is coming up on Thursday, September 6 at 7PM. [Dianne Marsh][2] has offered [SRT Solution&#8217;s][3] new office space to host this month&#8217;s meeting. It&#8217;s just a block south of the Arbor Networks office that we&#8217;ve been meeting at (it&#8217;s at the corner of Fifth and Washington in downtown Ann Arbor). I&#8217;ll post the address when I have it (you can check here or at the [MichiPUG][4] site).

Update: SRT&#8217;s address is 206 S. Fifth, Suite 200. Quoting Dianne: &#8220;That&#8217;s directly above the
  
Linux Box, at the corner of Fifth and Washington. Entrance to the
  
building is from Fifth, and the easiest way to get to our office is to
  
choose &#8220;2R&#8221; in the elevator.&#8221;

See you there on Thursday at 7!
