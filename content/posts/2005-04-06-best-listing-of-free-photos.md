Robin Good offers the [best listnig of free photos][1] that I&#8217;ve seen. I noticed that Flickr was listed as well, and I don&#8217;t think that all of the photos on Flickr are available for free use. It always pays to review usage terms before grabbing a graphic from a site. Via [Ian Landsman][2]
