I couple of days ago, I added the spiffy Obama badge on the right hand side of my blog. If I were Dave Barry, I&#8217;d write about how &#8220;this blog&#8221; is endorsing Obama. But, I&#8217;m not Dave Barry. _I&#8217;m_ endorsing Obama for President. He&#8217;s on the right side of technical issues, he&#8217;s got good ideas for a number of other issues _and_ he comes across as one with real integrity, which is something our government can use at this point. Check out the [xkcd endorsement][1] which parallels much of what I&#8217;ve been thinking.

BTW, I believe I am still a registered Republican, which I did at one point when I bought the whole &#8220;tax and spend&#8221; nonsense that the Republicans would spew forth. Don&#8217;t-tax-enough-and-spend has been the Republican motto for as long as I&#8217;ve been following politics. I&#8217;ve had enough of the bad economics, the secrecy and the trampling on American civil liberties. The Democrat gets my vote for President, and I hope that Democrat is Obama.
