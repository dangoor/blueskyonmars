Last week, I was looking at Swing application frameworks. It&#8217;s hard to consider creating a Java GUI application today and not consider the Eclipse platform as a possible framework. There is a document in CVS, [Rich Client Platform Facilities][1], that describes how Eclipse 3.0 will work as a platform for non-IDE applications. This is a specific, stated goal for Eclipse 3.0, and there appear to be many people in- and outside of IBM who are interested in this.
