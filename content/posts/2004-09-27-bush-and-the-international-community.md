Those that have followed my blog for a while, know that I&#8217;m supporting the guy who is not Bush. John Mauldin&#8217;s new &#8220;Outside the Box&#8221; newsletter has certainly been interesting so far, and this week&#8217;s entry is no exception. George Friedman writes about [Bush and the international community][1]. The perspective is very interesting and one that I haven&#8217;t seen. The theory is that politicians in other countries don&#8217;t like Bush, but are too invested in him to let him go. It also says that back here at home, Kerry&#8217;s view that we should have had more international consensus is not a majority view.

That may be true, but it is my view. Besides, Iraq really need not be the _only_ issue in this election. How about the exploding national debt, the cronyism, the attacks on the environment, the attacks on personal liberty, etc&#8230;?

This piece is interesting reading, regardless of where you fall in this election.
