This is the best summary of why electronic voting machines are a problem. I&#8217;ve certainly been aware (and scared) of the issues for some time, but there are a lot of people that aren&#8217;t. This is a good one to forward around to people you know who aren&#8217;t aware of the issues. This is a really important issue to fix before the next election, and only some people in the government are aware and care about this issue.

> Last week in Florida&#8217;s 13th Congressional district, the victory margin was only 386 votes out of 153,000. There&#8217;ll be a mandatory lawyered-up recount, but it won&#8217;t include the almost 18,000 votes that seem to have disappeared. The electronic voting machines didn&#8217;t include them in their final tallies, and there&#8217;s no backup to use for the recount. The district will pick a winner to send to Washington, but it won&#8217;t be because they are sure the majority voted for him. Maybe the majority did, and maybe it didn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s no way to know.
