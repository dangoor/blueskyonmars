Cory Doctorow, ever a good watchdog when it comes to DRM issues, has brought to light that [iTunes 4.7.1 reduces your ability to stream music][1]. The five streaming limit is not a problem for me, but that&#8217;s not Cory&#8217;s point. Cory has shown, time and again, that the real problem is the changeability of the restrictions. If all of the music is DRMed, then there can be increased tightening on the terms until the time comes that all notion of fair use has been erased by technology.

Hey, and AllOfMP3 is still legal!
