[IBM takes quantum leap][1] &#8211; _Big Blue researchers say they have used a newly developed computer to perform &#8216;the most complex quantum computation to date.&#8217; It&#8217;s a step forward._ [[ZDNet][2]] It&#8217;s funny that the most complex quantum computation was factoring 15 into 3 and 5, but you&#8217;ve got to start somewhere. It&#8217;s actually a bit frightening that they&#8217;re using factoring as their test case for these computers, because that means that the first large scale quantum computer they make will be able to break all encryption in use today.
