The debate over strongly typed languages vs. weakly typed languages rages on, and now we get [Bruce Eckel&#8217;s MindView, Inc: 5-2-03 Strong Typing vs. Strong Testing][1]. Bruce is a big Python fan (as am I), and he makes a good case as to why dynamic languages like Python are more productive _and_ still safe as long as you practice &#8220;strong testing&#8221;. I&#8217;m a believer in test driven development, so if you&#8217;re doing tests anyway, why do you need the rather weak confirmation that strong typing gives you?
