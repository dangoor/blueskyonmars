This is just [way too funny][1]. Hart Seely has compiled a book of the poems of &#8220;D.H. Rumsfeld&#8221;, culled from the transcripts of the Defense Secretary&#8217;s press conferences. This [excerpt][2] describes &#8220;The Unknown&#8221; as &#8220;his most disturbing work&#8221;. I describe it as &#8220;Rumsfeld makes speech, hilarity ensues&#8221;.

> _The Unknown_
> 
> As we know,
  
> There are known knowns.
  
> There are things we know we know.
  
> We also know
  
> There are known unknowns.
  
> That is to say
  
> We know there are some things
  
> We do not know.
  
> But there are unknown unknowns
  
> The ones we don&#8217;t know we know.
