Part 2 of CNET&#8217;s three parter on music talks about [Microsoft&#8217;s positioning in the online music biz][1]. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about Apple&#8217;s niche position in the marketplace, MS&#8217; monopoly, and the formats that will ultimately win. Toward the end of the article, Ecast CEO Van-AdibÃ© said:

> &#8220;In the Windows marketplace, WMA is now a de facto standard for secure music.&#8221;

In my opinion, the trick here is that &#8220;secure music&#8221; is a sham. _Consumers_ don&#8217;t want secure music. They want reasonably priced and _convenient_ music. If a consumer is unable to buy a song and play it on any computer in their house, in their portable player (or car player) and at work, then they&#8217;re not going to be happy with it. Almost by definition, the DRM systems don&#8217;t allow this. If they do somehow allow it, and it&#8217;s perfectly convenient, then you&#8217;ll have a winner in the format wars.
