As I had reported earlier on, my cousin Rob was planning a charity canoe event called [&#8220;The Big Moo Canoe&#8221;][1] to support [Heifer International][2]. Last month, he burned a solid 22,000 calories to complete the 250 mile route. He has a [nice wrapup page][3] for the event.

Donations are still open until July 20th, and Rob is hoping to turn this into an event that more people can take part in next year (send him email if you&#8217;re interested!)

Great job, Rob!
