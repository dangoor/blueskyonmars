B. Scott Anderson writes in [The Myth of External Program Documentation][1]:

> Weinberg asked the audience who among them had ever participated in a feasibility study where the answer came back &#8220;No&#8221;. Not a single hand of the 1,500 in attendance was raised. Which begs the question &#8220;how many of these documents are good science and how many are simply position papers.

I like his comment about how XP practitioners are at least honest in the fact that they don&#8217;t produce the stereotypical bits of documentation artifacts (whereas everyone else deludes themselves into thinking they are producing useful documentation artifacts).
