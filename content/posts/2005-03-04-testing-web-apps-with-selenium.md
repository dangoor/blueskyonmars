I&#8217;ve seen a couple of people mentioning Selenium, including this link to a great tutorial on Selenium&#8217;s standalone mode: [Agile Testing: Web app testing with Python part 2: Selenium and Twisted][1]. Selenium does web app acceptance testing _using your actual browser_. All other testing frameworks I&#8217;ve seen do direct HTTP communication and try to emulate a browser, generally neglecting JavaScript. As webapps get more dynamic, something like Selenium seems critical.
