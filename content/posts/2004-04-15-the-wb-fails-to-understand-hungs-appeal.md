[WB Seeks to Reward Bad Singers with Big Prizes][1] &#8211; yes, the &#8220;Anti-American Idol&#8221;, where the good singers get sent away. They&#8217;re hoping to reproduce William Hung&#8217;s sensational popularity (and, more importantly, _American Idol&#8217;s_). My take: not gonna happen. The _Idol_ audition shows were entertaining, certainly. And, William Hung had a style that truly made him stand out. But, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s enough show for an entire season to work. Also, I, for one, won&#8217;t buy Hung&#8217;s CD (or iTunes), because I can&#8217;t imagine actually listening to it. It&#8217;s _bad_ karaoke, after all.
