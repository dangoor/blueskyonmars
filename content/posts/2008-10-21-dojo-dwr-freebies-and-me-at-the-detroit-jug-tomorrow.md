The Detroit Java Users Group is meeting out at ePrize tomorrow for a talk about DWR and Dojo. I&#8217;ve been wanting to learn more about DWR, so this is a good chance. I&#8217;ll be heading out there to the meeting and [SitePen][1] has provided me with some Dojo goodies to give away (t-shirts, books and stickers).

I hope to see you there!
