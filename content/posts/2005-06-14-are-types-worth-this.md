Tim Bray, who has spoken out previously on the goodness of &#8220;scripting languages&#8221;, laments the pain caused by the combination of [Java Generics, Arrays, and Comparables][1]. Given Java&#8217;s strongly-typed nature, I think generics are a good thing, because they extend the typing protection. (If you&#8217;re going to buy in to static typing, you might as well go all the way!) If you are trying to compare arrays of objects in Java, you&#8217;d do well to look at Tim&#8217;s post and save yourself some time.

On seeing those snippets of code, I&#8217;m just happy to be working in a dynamically-typed language with friendly syntax. For folks who do like strongly-typed languages and want to be able to continue working with Java classes, take a look at [Nice][2] to see how things \*could\* work.
