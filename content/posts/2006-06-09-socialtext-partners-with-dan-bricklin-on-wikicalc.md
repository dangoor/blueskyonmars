[Socialtext Partners with Dan Bricklin on wikiCalc][1] is an interesting follow up to the Google Spreadsheet news. [I made the prediction][2] that Google&#8217;s going to (someday) sell a box that you can drop onto your company network that lets you do collaborative spreadsheets and document editing. Socialtext, it would appear, can do that for you _now_, and using open source software if you want to manage it yourself! Or, you can get hosted services or buy their hardware/software combo (just like the GOB I was talking about).

I had heard of Socialtext previously, but I wasn&#8217;t aware of the [SynchroEdit][3] connection and [wikiCalc][4] coming into the fold certainly makes things more interesting.
