I&#8217;ve just received notice that my proposed talk for [PyCon 2008][1] has been accepted!

People who were at my PyCon 2006 &#8220;Effective Ajax with TurboGears&#8221; talk might remember that I talked about sprinkling Ajax throughout a webapp as appropriate. A lot has changed in the nearly two years since. We can now move a lot more presentation logic to the browser, and the server side becomes much more of a web services layer.

I&#8217;m going to focus on what the server side looks like (this _is_ PyCon, after all!), using [Dojo][2] to easily implement the client side. I&#8217;m also going to talk about how you can integrate Comet (where the server sends messages back to the client) into a TurboGears 2 app.

The ideas will work in any web framework, and the code samples will also work with very little change in Pylons.

I&#8217;m looking forward to this talk, and I hope to see you there! (And don&#8217;t forget to say &#8216;hi&#8217; if you&#8217;re at [CodeMash][3] next month!)

_Update:_ Wow! Check out the [PyCon 2008 list of talks][4]. This will be my third PyCon, and I must say that that is the most impressive list of talks of the three.
