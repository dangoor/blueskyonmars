Senator Sam Brownback is reportedly planning to introduce a bill that would [limit copy protection][1], to ensure that consumers continue to have fair use rights and the ability to resell their digital goods.

> The bill, authored by Sen. Sam Brownback, would regulate digital rights management systems, granting consumers the right to resell copy-protected products and requiring digital media manufacturers to prominently disclose to consumers the presence of anticopying technology in their products.

The bill actually sounds like it has some things it in that will be difficult to make work. However, the more support that exists in Congress for bills of this nature, the better.
