A couple weeks ago, one of the Detroit pop stations mysteriously switched formats and started calling itself &#8220;Doug FM&#8221;. They described their new format, if I recall correctly, as being like you &#8220;dropped your iPod in a can of paint&#8221;. What it boils down to is that they don&#8217;t have a 25 song playlist of current music in some format. They play a variety of things from the 70s, 80s and early 90s (I haven&#8217;t heard more recent than that on there).

It turns out that Doug is part of a new breed that also includes [Bob, Jack, Dave and other radio stations][1].
