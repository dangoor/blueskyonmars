Marshall Brain&#8217;s WebKEW talks about [free photos for your web site][1]. He mentions \[stock.xchng\](http://www.sxc.hu/), which I linked to in \[Art Tips for Programmers\](http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2004/11/22/art-tips-for-programmers/).

The comments at WebKEW bring up a couple other links to sites that I hadn&#8217;t heard of: \[Yotophoto\](http://yotophoto.com/) and \[MorgueFile\](http://morguefile.com/).
