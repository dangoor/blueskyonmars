> Every time you buy an iPod, you are financing legal and technical countermeasures aimed at taking away legitimate features that enable you to do more with your lawfully acquired music and hardware.

This is true, and it is also true that Apple has been working closely with the RIAA. At some point, they may have leverage enough to push back on stupid piracy countermeasures. (Maybe that point is now, given the huge marketshare and 2 million units sold last _quarter</em). Trouble is, that it will be hard for them to justify taking that kind of stance, given that they're winning by such a large margin. The ultimate problem still lies with the fact that the only legal downloadable form of music that many people want to buy comes with DRM. Unless you buy it from Russia, of course. </p>
