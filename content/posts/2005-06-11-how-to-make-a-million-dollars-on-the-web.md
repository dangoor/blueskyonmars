Marshall Brain, creator of the most excellent [How Stuff Works][1] has posted a presentation he gave in which he talks about [how to make a million dollars][2]. The presentation is a nice, light read and is generally of the &#8220;motivational&#8221; sort, by which i mean that it&#8217;s main purpose appears to be to get you off your butt and start something. Which is a very worthy goal, to be sure.

As an adjunct to this, he has created [WebKEW][3], where he talks about making money online. There appears to be quite a bit of reading there, and it looks well worth checking out if you&#8217;re thinking of gettnig your own business going. (Some of what they have to say may even apply to folks not starting online businesses&#8230;)
