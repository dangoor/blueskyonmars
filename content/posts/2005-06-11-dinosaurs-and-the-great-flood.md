I love the net. Someone who goes by the name &#8220;The Ferrett&#8221; talks about [The Weirdest Book I Ever Got][1]. The book in question is a comic book by [Jim Pinkoski][2] called &#8220;A Creationist&#8217;s View of DINOSAURS and the Theory Of Evolution&#8221;. Take a look at The Ferrett&#8217;s scans from it!

Apparently, the dinosaurs were destroyed by the Great Flood after they tried to attack Noah&#8217;s Ark. You learn something new every day. (You really have to appreciate Jim Pinkoski&#8217;s enthusiasm!)
