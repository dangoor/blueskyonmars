I&#8217;m planning to go to tomorrow&#8217;s [Atlanta Python December Meetup][1]. I&#8217;m surprised that only 3 people are RSVPed as yes. The Michigan Python Users Group has gotten 8 people or more for its meetings. If you&#8217;re in Atlanta, stop in and say &#8216;hi&#8217;! I&#8217;d like to meet some more folks while I&#8217;m down here.
