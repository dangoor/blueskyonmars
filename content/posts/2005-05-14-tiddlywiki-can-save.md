A completely browser-based client side wiki is cool enough, but the recent versions of [TiddlyWiki][1] can even save your changes! That only works in Firefox and IE right now (I&#8217;m using Safari at the moment), but that is quite the achievement. Even the upgrade process is impressively easy. 

For folks into [Getting Things Done][2], Nathan Bowers has put together [GTD TiddlyWiki][3], a repackaging of TiddlyWiki that is designed to keep all of your next actions together.
