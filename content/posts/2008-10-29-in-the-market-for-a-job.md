Short form: I&#8217;m looking for a job. Are you doing something interesting? And hiring? Send me email! kid @at@ blazingthings.com.

I&#8217;ve opened up [my LinkedIn profile][1] to make it easier to get a quick rundown.

I bring a lot to the table: 20 years of experience in product management, management and software development. Some of my work in Python is out there and well-known. In September 2005, I released [TurboGears][2], which led to an interesting and fun flurry of activity for me (talks at [PyCon][3] 3 years running, plus talks at EuroPython, [CodeMash][4] and the upcoming [PyWorks][5] conference, the [Prentice-Hall book with Mark Ramm][6], the [self-produced and published DVD][7], etc). At [Arbor Networks][8], I applied Python (and others) in many parts of their security product, and even convinced them to release [TGWebServices][9], an open source library that takes the pain out of SOAP. And, this year at SitePen I released the [Paver][10] build tool.

Most recently, at [SitePen][11], I was the Product Manager in an otherwise custom services company. I oversaw the launch of SitePen&#8217;s growing [Support][12] service, and the [Dojo Toolbox][13], created in collaboration with Adobe.

Throughout my career, I&#8217;ve been taking collections of raw materials and turning out packages that customers can really use. In the earliest part of my career, I created insurance company billing software for doctors&#8217; offices. The people using that software were decided non-technical. I had to quickly learn to speak their language, figure out what they needed to accomplish and then make it happen. I also had to help spark their interest in our product.

And, I&#8217;ve been doing that all along. My audiences have varied and my role has varied (sometimes I&#8217;ve been a manager with people reporting to me, other times I&#8217;ve been a developer on the team), but the product management aspect has been there all along. I&#8217;ve also spent a couple of years doing enterprise sales and have been involved in marketing along the way.

Of course, I&#8217;m also a very technical person. I did a lot of the software development on the SitePen products I was involved with. I have a ton of experience in Python (going back to 1995), plus solid experience in JavaScript, Java and Perl. I&#8217;ve been using relational and other styles of databases forever. I&#8217;ve been using some variety of *nix since the early 1990s.

I&#8217;m located in Ann Arbor, Michigan and I&#8217;m willing to telecommute (and have done so for 4 of the past 10 years).

There are many jobs out there listed on the various jobs sites, but I also know that there are plenty of great opportunities that are _not_ listed on those sites. If you happen to know of one, let me know!
