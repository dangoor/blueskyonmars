Somehow, I missed Newsweek&#8217;s [Looking Grim at the Grammys][1] article. The article highlights how grim things look for the music business right now, using the Album of the Year winner &#8220;O Brother Where Art Thou&#8221; as a counter balance to the pop fluff on the radio. Purely commercial offerings don&#8217;t have as much sway with people who are musicians themselves, which is why _O Brother_ and India.Arie made an impact on the Grammys despite the lack of radio play.
