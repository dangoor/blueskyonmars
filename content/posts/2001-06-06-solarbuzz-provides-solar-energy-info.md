Yahoo featured a site called [Solarbuzz][1] today. Looks like a site chock full of great information about solar power. Good stuff for anyone interested in clean energy or additional energy, as in the case of California. [Solar Cost and Price Trends][2]: _&#8220;In 2001, a residential solar system costs about $8,000 per kWp installed.&#8221;_
