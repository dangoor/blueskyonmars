ruce Perens has responded to the W3C&#8217;s patent proposal in [this article at The Register][1]. The W3C&#8217;s proposed policy allows for standards that incorporate patents that are available for non-disctrimintory license fees, which pretty much shuts out open source software. My response to the W3C was that you&#8217;ll just end up getting forks like Ogg Vorbis and PNG.
