My last entry was October 30th. That&#8217;s most unfortunate, because there are all sorts of interesting things that have happened in the world and interesting things that I&#8217;ve found online. Just the other day, I found a fairly cool piece of software, but now I have no idea what it was called. And, it wouldn&#8217;t be easy to figure out search terms to locate this particular program. Had I just blogged it, I would&#8217;ve been able to find it trivially.
