In a week, I&#8217;ll be starting a new job with [JSTOR][1]. This should be a fun move and a fun job. When starting a new job, it&#8217;s always interesting to take a look at the technologies in their area and wonder &#8220;do they use that?&#8221; or &#8220;have they tried this?&#8221;. I&#8217;ve had a few thoughts along those lines. I just saw a mention of the DjVu format (which has a [free implementation][2]).

Sounds perfect for what JSTOR does.
