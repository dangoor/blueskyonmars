In [Apple Web Music Venture Ignites Industry][1], we get to read more praise for Apple&#8217;s iTunes Music Store. I&#8217;m generally bullish on the store, but the article contains this lovely &#8220;well, duh!&#8221; moment:

> &#8220;Apple&#8217;s success has shown that by loosening the restrictions on what consumers can do with the music, that&#8217;s the right way to compete with free&#8221; file sharing, [Dan] Hart [chief executive of rival Echo serivce] said.

People have been saying this for a long time. I think a legal service with a good selection of tunes in convenient MP3 form would be a hit.
