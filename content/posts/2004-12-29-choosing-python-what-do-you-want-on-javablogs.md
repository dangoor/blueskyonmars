For the past year and a half, I&#8217;ve been posting links and occasional articles on Java-related topics, averaging more than 60 reads from Javablogs. You may have been noticing an increasing number of links to Python related topics over the past couple of months. That&#8217;s because [I&#8217;ve switched my development to Python][1].

I will still be posting links and articles (more articles than before, even) on general programming related topics. I will also be posting info about running a software business. So, here are the choices of what I can feed Javablogs:

  1. Software development and Java-related articles
  2. Business of software articles
  3. Python-related articles

Some people might actually appreciate seeing some of what&#8217;s going on in the Python universe. My guess is that most people, though, would opt for #1 and #2 above. What do you think? Leave a comment or send email if you care.
