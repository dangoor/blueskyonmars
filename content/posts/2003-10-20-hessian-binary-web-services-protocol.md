Via [WIRED][1] I learned about [Hessian][2], which is a web services protocol designed by Caucho, the Resin people. It&#8217;s designed to be a very easy API, and since the protocol is binary you don&#8217;t need attachments to send binary files, which is something that may have value in some work that I&#8217;m doing.
