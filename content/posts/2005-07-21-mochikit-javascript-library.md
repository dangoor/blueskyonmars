You get spoiled by a lot fo the niceties of a high-level language like Python. JavaScript has \*some\* high-level features, but [MochiKit adds a bunch more][1]. I&#8217;ve been playing with MochiKit for a couple of weeks, and it has a very nice, solid design that does things in a way that is both JavaScripty and Pythonic.

Bob Ippolito is doing a great job with it. Take a look!
