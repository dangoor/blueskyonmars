[The Michigan Python Users Group][1] _usually_ meets on the first Thursday of the month. This month, we&#8217;ve got a change in plans.

Stephan Diehl will be visiting from Berlin and has offered to give a talk about PyPy and Stackless. To fit with his schedule, we&#8217;ve moved the MichiPUG meeting to Wednesday, May 16th at 7PM. And, to really mix things up, we&#8217;ll be holding the meeting at the [Ann Arbor IT Zone][2].

I expect that we&#8217;ll have a good bit of discussion about PyPy and Stackless to follow Stephan&#8217;s talk.

Hope to see you there!
