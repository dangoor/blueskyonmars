The funny thing about this particular &#8220;usability&#8221; problem is that I honest-to-goodness can&#8217;t use the application! I tried to fire up Photoshop Elements on my Mac just now, and it&#8217;s hung up trying to receive some kind of update from Adobe. There&#8217;s a Cancel button that doesn&#8217;t do anything. There&#8217;s a progress meter that&#8217;s stuck halfway. The cursor is the spinning color wheel (same as the hourglass, for those of you using Windows). While it&#8217;s doing this, Photoshop Elements is also hogging all of my CPU&#8230; looks like someone got into an infinite loop.

The thing is, I don&#8217;t _care_ about whatever silly file Adobe wants to update. I just want to scan something! They&#8217;ve actually rendererd the software unlaunchable! Argh.
