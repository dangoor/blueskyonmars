Microsoft&#8217;s [Simple List Extensions Specification][1] is, in fact, simple. I do think there is value in where they&#8217;re headed with this, because this provides some more machine-readable data that is presently user-configured in tools like Zesty News.

It is great to see something that looks different from the &#8220;embrace and extend&#8221; Microsoft of old: this spec uses XML namespaces, making it pretty transparent to existing tools. And, the spec is published under a Creative Commons license with a royalty-free grant to use any Microsoft patents that may cover this particular spec.
