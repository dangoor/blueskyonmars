I&#8217;m in the habit of using Google to look up Java class APIs. Usually, the first couple of links point to a couple of different versions of the javadoc at Sun&#8217;s site. If you don&#8217;t care about exactly which version of the javadoc you&#8217;re looking at, this generally works fine. But, check out this [Google Search for JCheckBox][1]. The first link points to the 1.4.1 javadoc which, as of today, points to a page saying that 1.4.1 has been End of Lifed, so no javadoc for you, bucko. This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if Google had the 1.4.2 link as well, but they don&#8217;t. It also wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if Sun provided a link to the current version of the javadoc, but they don&#8217;t. I guess it&#8217;s time for me to actually have a local copy of the javadoc around.
