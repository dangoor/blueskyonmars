In the NYTimes article [Bush Defends War, Sidestepping Issue of Faulty Intelligence][1], White House spokesman Ari Fleischer is quoted as saying:

> &#8220;I think the burden is on those people who think he [Saddam] didn&#8217;t have weapons of mass destruction to tell the world where they are.&#8221;

Am I just reading this wrong? How can someone tell the world where something that Saddam doesn&#8217;t have are?
