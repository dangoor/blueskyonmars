  <a &nbsp;HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761121323/blueskyonmars-20">What to Expect When You&#8217;re Expecting</a> &#8211; a book that everyone tells you to get, and with good reason. Covers many of the things that come up during pregnancy. This is a great guide to read before pregnancy so that you know what you&#8217;re getting yourself into.

  <a &nbsp;HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0452276594/blueskyonmars-20">Natural Childbirth the Bradley Way</a> &#8211; This book was good for teaching us the Bradley method. Surekha and I both think that natural childbirth is great, but we also know that science can offer a lot to ensure the safety, well-being and comfort of a laboring woman and unborn child. Even though we chose to go ahead with medical interventions, I still recommend this book for anyone who would ideally have a natural childbirth.

  <a &nbsp;HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0894805770/blueskyonmars-20">What to Expect the First Year</a> &#8211; Everything that&#8217;s good about the other What To Expect&#8230; book applies here.
