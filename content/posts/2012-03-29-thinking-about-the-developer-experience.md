I&#8217;ve been working on developer tools for a while now, and I&#8217;m really proud of what we are shipping in Firefox today and the new features that are right around the corner. Browser tools are one of the most important parts of a web developer&#8217;s toolbox.

But, there&#8217;s a lot more that goes into web development than the browser tools. The video above and the text that follows are some thoughts on the whole of the web developer&#8217;s experience.

Web development is great because the platform is so high level and dynamic. That makes it easy to get started. There&#8217;s a massive collection of libraries, tools, books, tutorials and more to help web developers get things done once they&#8217;ve moved beyond the first steps. In fact, there&#8217;s so much out there that it can be hard for someone getting going to decide how to go from idea to done. The riches of the web ecosystem are both a blessing and a curse. It&#8217;s more blessing than curse, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any easier for newcomers and, in some instances, for experienced developers that are moving into a new area or applying a new technology.

Mozilla&#8217;s non-profit mission is to protect openness and innovation on the web. We want to make the web better for everyone, and I think we&#8217;re in a good position to help guide developers from idea to published app. Doing so is especially critical for our [Apps initiative][1].

To that end, Daniel Buchner and I will be looking beyond developer tools in our product plans to include the whole of the [developer experience][2]. This will first show up in an Apps context, but we&#8217;re going to look for ways to apply what we do more broadly.
