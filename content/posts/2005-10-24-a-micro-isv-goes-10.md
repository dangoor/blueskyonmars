A hearty congratulations to Ian Landsman for shipping [HelpSpot 1.0][1]. I feel a kinship with Ian because he started UserScape about the same time that I started Blazing Things. He and I have been exchanging email periodically all year, and he&#8217;s a great guy who knows his stuff. Shipping a beta is exciting, but shipping 1.0 is the ultimate!
