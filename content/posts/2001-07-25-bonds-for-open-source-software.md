Slashdot had a mention of a [paper describing a system for bonds for open source software][1]. This seems like a viable way to get open source software made. (Not necessarily the only way, mind you.) I&#8217;m at a commercial company that is currently working on a to-be-announced open source project&#8230; and I fully believe that this undertaking will be a successful one for us.
