[What You Can&#8217;t Say][1] is a great essay on open minded thinking by Paul Graham. In it, he frames a historical and cultural basis for identifying thoughts that people are trying to supress. He stresses that you should be open in your thinking, even if you don&#8217;t outwardly express everything you&#8217;re thinking. I wonder how many people think the whole notion of attacking taboos in general is heretical?

As he points out in the beginning, this article is also useful for people publishing weblogs. Weblogs are public speech&#8230; don&#8217;t put something on your blog unless you&#8217;re willing to answer to it later.
