Bush seemed to say a lot of silly things while he was compaigning, but it didn&#8217;t stop there&#8230; Speaking in Japan, Bush talked about &#8220;the devaluation issue&#8221;. Asian markets are very sensitive to the price of the yen, so talk of devaluation makes people nervous. What Bush had meant was &#8220;deflation&#8221;. Sure, anyone can make these mistakes&#8230; it&#8217;s just the frequency and severity that differs.
