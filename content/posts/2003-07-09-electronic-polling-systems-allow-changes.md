Though these articles are written in a very &#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221; sort of way, it is interesting to read about some of the [internals of electronic election systems][1]. This is scary stuff, because we certainly wouldn&#8217;t want our election systems becoming _less_ accurate than with old paper ballots. (And having a less accurate audit trail to boot!)
