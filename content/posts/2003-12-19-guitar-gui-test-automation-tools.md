Found via Carlos&#8217; [list of open source automated test tools][1]: [The GUITAR Project][2] is designed to generate, run and report on tests that exercise a GUI (and it looks like it supports both Java and Windows GUIs). Reports include coverage information. The website for this tool definitely has the &#8220;research&#8221; sort of look to it, so I don&#8217;t know if anyone applies this to &#8220;real&#8221; apps. Anything that can help automate GUI testing is a boon, though.
