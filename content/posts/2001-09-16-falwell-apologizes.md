Jerry Falwell [apologized][1] for implying that gays and lesbians were the cause of Tuesday&#8217;s attack. He said that blame lies solely with the terrorists. But, he also said that perhaps, as indicated in the Bible, God&#8217;s protection has been lifted from America because of the &#8220;secularization&#8221;. In the same article, Robertson is quoted as saying that the Supreme Court took away the Bible from school children.

Haven&#8217;t these people read the Bill of Rights? This is a nation with _freedom of religion_. If they don&#8217;t like that, they can try to start their own Christian fundamentalist country, and see what it&#8217;s like to live apart from the world.
